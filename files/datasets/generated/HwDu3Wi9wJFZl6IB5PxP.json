Yet many current microprocessors provide only weak support for these operations. The latency and throughput of division are typically far inferior to those of floating-point addition and multiplication, and square-root performance is often even lower. This article argues the case for high-performance division and square root. It also explains the algorithms and implementations of the primary techniques, subtractive and multiplicative methods, employed in microprocessor floating-point units with their associated area/performance tradeoffs. Case studies of representative floating-point  unit configurations are presented, supported by simulation results using a carefully selected benchmark, Givens rotation, to show the dynamic performance impact of the various implementation alternatives. The topology of the implementation is found to be an important performance factor. Multiplicative algorithms, such as the Newton-Raphson method and Goldschmidt's algorithm, can achieve low latencies. However, these implementations serialize multiply, divide, and square root operations through a single pipeline, which can lead to low throughput. While this hardware sharing yields low size requirements for baseline implementations, lower-latency versions require many times more area. For these reasons, multiplicative implementations are best suited to cases where subtractive methods are  precluded by area constraints, and modest performance on divide and square root operations is tolerable. Subtractive algorithms, exemplified by radix-4 SRT and radix-16 SRT, can be made to execute in parallel with other floating-point operations.","title":"Area and performance tradeoffs in floating-point divide and square-root implementations","doi":"doi>10.1145/243439.243481"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100069641","last_name":"soderquist","fist_name":"peter","full_name":"Peter Soderquist"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100439544","last_name":"leeser","fist_name":"miriam","full_name":"Miriam Leeser"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Can computational logic provide a paradigm for both the specification and implementation of concurrent systems?","doi":"doi>10.1145/234528.234733"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81546931656","last_name":"gilbert","fist_name":"david","full_name":"David Gilbert"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Type inference for objects","doi":"doi>10.1145/234528.234750"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Annotated type and effect systems","doi":"doi>10.1145/234528.234745"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Imperative functional programming","doi":"doi>10.1145/234528.234736"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"s","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100154268","last_name":"reddy","fist_name":"u","full_name":"U S Reddy"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"We present an overview of the program transformation methodology, focusing our attention on the so-called “rules + strategies” approach in the case of functional and logic programs.

He defined a system asself-stabilizingwhen “regardless of its initial state, it is guaranteed to arrive at a legitimate state in a finite number of steps.” A system which is not self-stabilizing may stay in an illegitimate state forever. Dijkstra's notion of self-stabilization, which originally had a very narrow scope of application, is proving to encompass a formal and unified approach to fault tolerance under a model of transient failures for distributed systems. In this paper we define self-stabilization, examine its significance in the context of fault tolerance, define the important research themes that have arisen from it, and discuss the relevant results. In addition to the issues arising from Dijkstra's original presentation as well as several related issues, we discuss methodologies for designing self-stabilizing systems, the role of compilers with respect to self-stabilization, and some of the factors that prevent self-stabilization.","title":"Self-stabilization","doi":"doi>10.1145/151254.151256"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332525877","last_name":"schneider","fist_name":"marco","full_name":"Marco Schneider"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The goal in computer vision systems is to analyze data collected from the environment and derive an interpretation to complete a specified task.

During the 1980s, development of applications by “end users” accelerated and became a key management and research concern. Known as “end-user computing,” the phenomena and research associated with this trend cross a variety of disciplines. This article critically surveys the published literature on end-user computing (EUC) management according to a comprehensive research model. The article introduces the EUC management research model, identifies prior research contributions, and offers guideline for the future. The focal points of the model are two EUC management components which represent two different levels of theorizing found in the  literature. The first level focuses on the organization factors of strategy, technology, and management action. The second level focuses on the individual factors of end user, task, tool, and end-user action. The remainder of the model includes factors typically investigated as the antecedents (context) and consequences (outcomes) of EUC. More than 90 English-language articles published from 1983-1990 are mapped into the model. Specific variables for each factor are identified; research streams are interpreted; findings are synthesized; and gaps in our knowledge are highlighted. We then raise a number of substantive and methodological issues that need to be addressed and suggest two themes we envision as important for EUC management research in the 1990s: EUC as an extension of  organizational computing and EUC as a social learning phenomenon. Guidance is offered for using these theme to inform future research.","title":"The management of end-user computing: status and directions","doi":"doi>10.1145/162124.162138"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"c","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100361550","last_name":"brancheau","fist_name":"james","full_name":"James C Brancheau"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"v","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100014654","last_name":"brown","fist_name":"carol","full_name":"Carol V Brown"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Finding a binary encoding of symbolic control states, such that the implementation area of a digital control unit is minimized is well known to be NP-complete.

We provide a survey of Internet geolocation technologies with an emphasis on adversarial contexts; that is, we consider how this technology performs against a knowledgeable adversary whose goal is to evade geolocation. We do so by examining first the limitations of existing techniques, and then, from this base, determining how best to evade existing geolocation techniques. We also consider two further geolocation techniques which may be of use even against adversarial targets: (1) the extraction of client IP addresses using functionality introduced in the 1.5 Java API, and (2) the collection of round-trip times using HTTP refreshes. These techniques illustrate that the seemingly straightforward technique of evading geolocation by relaying traffic through a proxy server (or network of proxy servers) is not as straightforward as many end-users might expect.

Effectively programming such reconfigurable architectures, however, is an extremely cumbersome and error-prone process, as it requires programmers to assume the role of hardware designers while mastering hardware description languages, thus limiting the acceptance and dissemination of this promising technology. To address this problem, researchers have developed numerous approaches at both the programming languages as well as the compilation levels, to offer high-level programming abstractions that would allow programmers to easily map applications to reconfigurable architectures. This survey describes the major research efforts on compilation techniques for reconfigurable computing architectures. The survey focuses on efforts that map computations written in imperative programming languages to reconfigurable architectures and identifies the main compilation and synthesis techniques used in this mapping.","title":"Compiling for reconfigurable computing: A survey","doi":"doi>10.1145/1749603.1749604"}]},{"row":[{"link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100097307"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"c","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81377592829","last_name":"diniz","fist_name":"pedro","full_name":"Pedro C Diniz"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100235385","last_name":"weinhardt","fist_name":"markus","full_name":"Markus Weinhardt"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The collection of digital information by governments, corporations, and individuals has created tremendous opportunities for knowledge- and information-based decision making. Driven by mutual benefits, or by regulations that require certain data to be published, there is a demand for the exchange and publication of data among various parties. Data in its original form, however, typically contains sensitive information about individuals, and publishing such data will violate individual privacy. The current practice in data publishing relies mainly on policies and guidelines as to what types of data can be published and on agreements on the use of published data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection.Privacy-preserving data publishing(PPDP) provides methods and tools for publishing useful information while preserving data privacy. Recently, PPDP has received considerable attention in research communities, and many approaches have been proposed for different data publishing scenarios. In this survey, we will systematically summarize and evaluate different approaches to PPDP, study the challenges in practical data publishing, clarify the differences and requirements that distinguish PPDP from other related problems, and propose future research directions.","title":"Privacy-preserving data publishing: A survey of recent developments","doi":"doi>10.1145/1749603.1749605"}]},{"row":[{"link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327488637"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350574174","last_name":"wang","fist_name":"ke","full_name":"Ke Wang"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430620659","last_name":"chen","fist_name":"rui","full_name":"Rui Chen"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"In recent years, blogging has become an exploding passion among Internet communities.

Vlogs have gained much attention worldwide, especially with Google's acquisition of YouTube. This article presents a comprehensive survey of videoblogging (vlogging for short) as a new technological trend. We first summarize the technological challenges for vlogging as four key issues that need to be answered. Along with their respective possibilities, we give a review of the currently available techniques and tools supporting vlogging, and envision emerging technological directions for future vlogging. Several multimedia technologies are introduced to empower vlogging technology with better scalability, interactivity, searchability, and accessability, and to potentially reduce the legal, economic, and moral risks of vlogging applications. We also make an in-depth investigation of various vlog mining topics from a research perspective and present several incentive applications such as user-targeted video advertising and collective intelligence gaming. We believe that vlogging and its applications will bring new opportunities and drives to the research in related fields.","title":"Vlogging: A survey of videoblogging technology on the web","doi":"doi>10.1145/1749603.1749606"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100131951","last_name":"gao","fist_name":"wen","full_name":"Wen Gao"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100106782","last_name":"tian","fist_name":"yonghong","full_name":"Yonghong Tian"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594423","last_name":"huang","fist_name":"tiejun","full_name":"Tiejun Huang"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372591186","last_name":"yang","fist_name":"qiang","full_name":"Qiang Yang"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"No document standard is sufficient for all purposes because the requirements significantly differ among businesses, industries, and geopolitical regions.

Therefore, the design of algorithm components must also incorporate software-engineering aspects. A key design goal is adaptability. This goal is important for maintenance throughout a project, prototypical development, and reuse in new, unforseen contexts. From a theoretical viewpoint most algorithms apply  to a range of possible use scenarios. Ideally, each algorithm is implemented by one algorithm component, which is easily, safely, and efficiently adaptable to all of these contexts.Various techniques have been developed for the design and implementation of algorithm components. However, a common basis for systematic, detailed evaluations and comparisons in view of therealpractical needs is still missing. Basically, this means a set of concrete criteria, which specify what sort of adaptability isreallyrequired in practice, and which are well-justified by convincing, representative use scenarios.This paper is intended to be a first “milestone” on the way towards such a system of criteria. We will present a set of concrete goals, which are general and problem-independent and might appear ubiquitously in the algorithmic realm. These goals are illustrated, motivated, and justified by an extensive requirements analysis for a particular algorithm from a     particular algorithmic domain: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths in networks.Clearly, the field of algorithmics might be too versatile to allow a comprehensive, yet concise set of precise, justified criteria. Even a domain as restricted as graph and network algorithms includes aspects that are not fully understood. The analysis will include a discussion of the limits of the case study and the scope of the goals. The case study was chosen because it seems to be close to the “boderline” between the aspects that are well understood and the aspects that are not. Hence, this example may well serve as an“acid test” for programming techniques in view of the state of the art.","title":"A software engineering perspective on algorithmics","doi":"doi>10.1145/375360.375367"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100547799","last_name":"weihe","fist_name":"karsten","full_name":"Karsten Weihe"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Many tasks require “reasoning”—i.e., deriving conclusions from a corpus of explicitly stored information—to solve their range of problems.

Because of this, the same ideas have been reconceived several times, and very different presentations have been given for the same approaches. We present some basic results that explain the intrinsic difficulty of the search problem.

An important research issue in the field of multimedia databases is the content-based retrieval of similar multimedia objects such as images, text, and videos. However, in contrast to searching data in a relational database, a content-based retrieval requires the search of similar objects as a basic functionality of the database system. Most of the approaches addressing similarity search use a so-called feature transformation that transforms important properties of the multimedia objects into high-dimensional points (feature vectors). Thus, the similarity search is transformed into a search of points in the feature space that are close to a given query point in the high-dimensional feature space. Query processing in high-dimensional spaces has therefore been a very active research area over the last few years. A number of new index structures and algorithms have been proposed. It has been shown that the new index structures considerably improve the performance in querying large multimedia databases. Based on recent tutorials [Berchtold and Keim 1998], in this survey we provide an overview of the current state of the art in querying multimedia databases, describing the index structures and algorithms for an efficient query processing in high-dimensional spaces. We identify the problems of processing queries in high-dimensional space, and we provide an overview of the proposed approaches to overcome these problems.","title":"Searching in high-dimensional spaces: Index structures for improving the performance of multimedia databases","doi":"doi>10.1145/502807.502809"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100395758","last_name":"bohm","fist_name":"christian","full_name":"Christian Bohm"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100293340","last_name":"berchtold","fist_name":"stefan","full_name":"Stefan Berchtold"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Data sets in large applications are often too massive to fit completely inside the computers internal memory. The resulting input/output communication (or I/O) between fast internal memory and slower external memory (such as disks) can be a major performance bottleneck. In this article we survey the state of the art in the design and analysis of external memory (or EM) algorithms and data structures, where the goal is to exploit locality in order to reduce the I/O costs. We consider a variety of EM paradigms for solving batched and online problems efficiently in external memory. For the batched problem of sorting and related problems such as permuting and fast Fourier transform, the key paradigms include distribution and merging. The paradigm of disk striping offers an elegant way to use multiple disks in parallel. For sorting, however,  disk striping can be nonoptimal with respect to I/O, so to gain further improvements we discuss distribution and merging techniques for using the disks independently. We also consider useful techniques for batched EM problems involving matrices (such as matrix multiplication and transposition), geometric data (such as finding intersections and constructing convex hulls), and graphs (such as list ranking, connected components, topological sorting, and shortest paths). In the online domain, canonical EM applications include dictionary lookup and range searching. The two important classes of indexed data structures are based upon extendible hashing and B-trees. The paradigms of filtering and bootstrapping provide a convenient means in online data structures to make effective use of the data accessed from disk. We also reexamine some of the above EM problems in slightly different settings, such as when the data items are moving, when the data items are variable-length (e.g., text strings), or when the allocated amount of internal memory can change dynamically. Programming tools and environments are available for simplifying the EM programming task. During the course of the survey, we report on some experiments in the domain of spatial databases using the TPIE system (transparent parallel I/O programming environment). The newly developed EM algorithms and data structures that incorporate the paradigms we discuss are significantly faster than methods currently used in practice.","title":"External memory algorithms and data structures: dealing withmassive data","doi":"doi>10.1145/384192.384193"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Design diversity has been used for many years now as a means of achieving a degree of fault tolerance in software-based systems.

This difficulty arises because assumptions of independence of failures between different versions have been shown to be untenable: assessment of the actual level of dependence present is therefore needed, and this is difficult.

An alternative trend of using collaboration in order to improve security has gained momentum over the past few years. Collaborative security is an abstract concept that applies to a wide variety of systems and has been used to solve security issues inherent in distributed environments. Thus far, collaboration has been used in many domains such as intrusion detection, spam filtering, botnet resistance, and vulnerability detection. In this survey, we focus on different mechanisms of collaboration and defense in collaborative security. We systematically investigate numerous use cases of collaborative security by covering six types of security systems. Aspects of these systems are thoroughly studied, including their technologies, standards, frameworks, strengths and weaknesses. We then present a comprehensive study with respect to their analysis target, timeliness of analysis, architecture, network infrastructure, initiative, shared information and interoperability. We highlight five important topics in collaborative security, and identify challenges and possible directions for future research. Our work contributes the following to the existing research on collaborative security with the goal of helping to make collaborative security systems more resilient and efficient.

The collection and analysis of such data has the potential to support various applications, including personalized medical services. While the benefits of the genomics revolution are trumpeted by the biomedical community, the increased availability of such data has major implications for personal privacy; notably because the genome has certain essential features, which include (but are not limited to)(i)an association with traits and certain diseases,(ii)identification capability (e.g., forensics), and(iii)revelation of family relationships. Moreover, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulated environments, such as the Internet and for-profit companies. The problem of genome data privacy thus resides at the crossroads of computer science, medicine, and public policy. While the computer scientists have addressed data privacy for various data types, there has been less attention dedicated to genomic data. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide a systematization of knowledge for the computer science community. In doing so, we address some of the (sometimes erroneous) beliefs of this field and we report on a survey we conducted about genome data privacy with biomedical specialists. Then, after characterizing the genome privacy problem, we review the state-of-the-art regarding privacy attacks on genomic data and strategies for mitigating such attacks, as well as contextualizing these attacks from the perspective of medicine and public policy.

Continuous scaling and increasing temperatures due to growing power density are threatening lifetime reliability. Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has been known for decades, but its impact has been insignificant compared to other factors. Aggressive scaling, however, makes NBTI the most serious threat to chip lifetime reliability in today's and future process technologies. The delay of microprocessors gradually increases as time goes by, due to stress and recovery phases. The delay eventually becomes higher than the value required to meet design constraints, which results in failed systems. In this article, the mechanism of NBTI and its effects on lifetime reliability are presented, then various techniques to mitigate NBTI degradation on microprocessors are introduced. The mitigation can be addressed at either the circuit level or architectural level. Circuit-level techniques include design-time techniques such as transistor sizing and NBTI-aware synthesis. Forward body biasing, and adaptive voltage scaling are adaptive techniques that can mitigate NBTI degradation at the circuit level by controlling the threshold voltage or supply voltage to hide the lengthened delay caused by NBTI degradation. Reliability has been regarded as something to be addressed by chip manufacturers. However, there are recent attempts to bring lifetime reliability problems to the architectural level. Architectural techniques can reduce the cost added by circuit-level techniques, which are based on the worst-case degradation estimation. Traditional low-power and thermal management techniques can be successfully extended to deal with reliability problems since aging is dependent on power consumption and temperature. Self-repair is another option to enhance the lifetime of microprocessors using either core-level or lower-level redundancy. With a growing thermal crisis and constant scaling, lifetime reliability requires more intensive research in conjunction with other design issues.","title":"Lifetime Reliability Enhancement of Microprocessors: Mitigating the Impact of Negative Bias Temperature Instability","doi":"doi>10.1145/2785988"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496676973","last_name":"hong","fist_name":"hyejeong","full_name":"Hyejeong Hong"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658743795","last_name":"lim","fist_name":"jaeil","full_name":"Jaeil Lim"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658751300","last_name":"lim","fist_name":"hyunyul","full_name":"Hyunyul Lim"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452597534","last_name":"kang","fist_name":"sungho","full_name":"Sungho Kang"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Data centers in public, private, and hybrid cloud settings make it possible to provision virtual machines (VMs) with unprecedented flexibility.

There are, however, challenges that limit the use of this mechanism; the most significant of these is the semantic gap problem.

By tracing the evolution of out-of-VM security solutions, this article examines and classifies different approaches that have been proposed to overcome the semantic gap—the fundamental challenge in hypervisor-based monitoring—and how they have been used to develop various security applications. In particular, we review how the past approaches address different constraints, such as practicality, flexibility, coverage, and automation, while bridging the semantic gap; how they have developed different monitoring systems; and how the monitoring systems have been applied and deployed.

The aim is to recognize the sequence of actions by a specific person using sensor readings. Most of the research has been devoted to activity recognition of single occupants in the environment. However, living environments are usually inhabited by more than one person and possibly with pets. Hence, human activity recognition in the context of multioccupancy is more general, but also more challenging.

Many protocol specifications are unknown, unavailable, or minimally documented, which prevents thorough analysis of the protocol for security purposes. For example, modern botnets often use undocumented and unique application-layer communication protocols to maintain command and control over numerous distributed hosts. Inferring the specification of closed protocols has numerous advantages, such as intelligent deep packet inspection, enhanced intrusion detection system algorithms for communications, and integration with legacy software packages. The multitude of closed protocols coupled with existing time-intensive reverse engineering methodologies has spawned investigation into automated approaches for reverse engineering of closed protocols. This article summarizes and organizes previously presented automatic protocol reverse engineering tools by approach. Approaches that focus on reverse engineering the finite state machine of a target protocol are separated from those that focus on reverse engineering the protocol format.","title":"A Survey of Automatic Protocol Reverse Engineering Tools","doi":"doi>10.1145/2840724"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658635186","last_name":"narayan","fist_name":"john","full_name":"John Narayan"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"k","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658772099","last_name":"shukla","fist_name":"sandeep","full_name":"Sandeep K Shukla"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"charles","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336488261","last_name":"clancy","fist_name":"t","full_name":"T Charles Clancy"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Software energy profilers are the tools to measure the energy consumption of mobile devices, applications running on those devices, and various hardware components.

This study aims to provide researchers and Web data curators with comprehensive answers to the following questions: What are the existing approaches and methods for assessing and ranking UGC? What features and metrics have been used successfully to assess and predict UGC value across a range of application domains? What methods can be effectively employed to maximize that value? This survey is composed of a systematic review of approaches for assessing and ranking UGC: results are obtained by identifying and comparing methodologies within the context of short text-based UGC on the Web. Existing assessment and ranking approaches adopt one of four framework types: the community-based framework takes into consideration the value assigned to content by a crowd of humans, the end-user--based framework adapts and personalizes the assessment and ranking process with respect to a single end-user, the designer-based framework encodes the software designer’s values in the assessment and ranking method, and the hybrid framework employs methods from more than one of these types. This survey suggests a need for further experimentation and encourages the development of new approaches for the assessment and ranking of UGC.","title":"A Survey on Assessment and Ranking Methodologies for User-Generated Content on the Web","doi":"doi>10.1145/2811282"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467671798","last_name":"momeni","fist_name":"elaheh","full_name":"Elaheh Momeni"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100033277","last_name":"cardie","fist_name":"claire","full_name":"Claire Cardie"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309489274","last_name":"diakopoulos","fist_name":"nicholas","full_name":"Nicholas Diakopoulos"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Over the last decades, modeling of user mobility has become increasingly important in mobile networking research and development.

This article systematically surveys the landscape of SLA-based cloud research to understand the state of the art and identify open problems. The survey is particularly aimed at the resource allocation phase of the SLA life cycle while highlighting implications on other phases. Results indicate that (i) minimal number of SLA parameters are accounted for in most studies; (ii) heuristics, policies, and optimisation are the most commonly used techniques for resource allocation; and (iii) the monitor-analysis-plan-execute (MAPE) architecture style is predominant in autonomic cloud systems.

By reviewing the details of these two categories of schemes respectively, we summarize and compare how existing schemes address technical issues such as log size, record slowdown, replay slowdown, implementation cost, and probe effect, which may shed some light on future studies on deterministic replay.","title":"Deterministic Replay: A Survey","doi":"doi>10.1145/2790077"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81435601664","last_name":"chen","fist_name":"yunji","full_name":"Yunji Chen"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658688940","last_name":"zhang","fist_name":"shijin","full_name":"Shijin Zhang"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501675982","last_name":"guo","fist_name":"qi","full_name":"Qi Guo"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485651363","last_name":"li","fist_name":"ling","full_name":"Ling Li"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658705940","last_name":"wu","fist_name":"ruiyang","full_name":"Ruiyang Wu"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447593542","last_name":"chen","fist_name":"tianshi","full_name":"Tianshi Chen"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks are widely advocated to monitor environmental parameters, structural integrity of the built environment and use of urban spaces, services and utilities. However, embedded sensors are vulnerable to compromise by external actors through malware but also through their wireless and physical interfaces. Compromised sensors can be made to report false measurements with the aim to produce inappropriate and potentially dangerous responses. Such malicious data injections can be particularly difficult to detect if multiple sensors have been compromised as they could emulate plausible sensor behaviour such as failures or detection of events where none occur. This survey reviews the related work on malicious data injection in wireless sensor networks, derives general principles and a classification of approaches within this domain, compares related studies and identifies areas that require further investigation.","title":"Detecting Malicious Data Injections in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey","doi":"doi>10.1145/2818184"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"p","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658756047","last_name":"illiano","fist_name":"vittorio","full_name":"Vittorio P Illiano"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The increase in energy consumption is the most critical problem worldwide.

Even if substantial research effort has been dedicated to addressing trust-based mechanisms or trust metrics (or computation) in diverse contexts, prior work has not clearly solved the issue of how to model and quantify trust with sufficient detail and context-based adequateness. The issue of trust quantification has become more complicated as we have the need to derive trust from complex, composite networks that may involve four distinct layers of communication protocols, information exchange, social interactions, and cognitive motivations. In addition, the diverse application domains require different aspects of trust for decision making such as emotional, logical, and relational trust. This survey aims to outline the foundations of trust models for applications in these contexts in terms of the concept of trust, trust assessment, trust constructs, trust scales, trust properties, trust formulation, and applications of trust. We discuss how different components of trust can be mapped to different layers of a complex, composite network; applicability of trust metrics and models; research challenges; and future work directions.","title":"A Survey on Trust Modeling","doi":"doi>10.1145/2815595"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550165556","last_name":"cho","fist_name":"jin-hee","full_name":"Jin-Hee Cho"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658665946","last_name":"chan","fist_name":"kevin","full_name":"Kevin Chan"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100172970","last_name":"adali","fist_name":"sibel","full_name":"Sibel Adali"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Linearisability is a key correctness criterion for concurrent data structures, ensuring that each history of the concurrent object under consideration is consistent with respect to a history of the corresponding abstract data structure. Linearisability allows concurrent (i.e., overlapping) operation calls to take effect in any order, but requires the real-time order of nonoverlapping to be preserved. The sophisticated nature of concurrent objects means that linearisability is difficult to judge, and hence, over the years, numerous techniques for verifying lineasizability have been developed using a variety of formal foundations such as data refinement, shape analysis, reduction, etc. However, because the underlying framework, nomenclature, and terminology for each method is different, it has become difficult for practitioners to evaluate the differences between each approach, and hence, evaluate the methodology most appropriate for verifying the data structure at hand. In this article, we compare the major of methods for verifying linearisability, describe the main contribution of each method, and compare their advantages and limitations.","title":"Verifying Linearisability: A Comparative Survey","doi":"doi>10.1145/2796550"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100291895","last_name":"dongol","fist_name":"brijesh","full_name":"Brijesh Dongol"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The vertex-centric programming model is an established computational paradigm recently incorporated into distributed processing frameworks to address challenges in large-scale graph processing. Billion-node graphs that exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not well supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce, which are notoriously poor performing for iterative graph algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges one to “think like a vertex” (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an operating system, are composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of which a thorough understanding is necessary in order to elicit top performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV frameworks are deconstructed into four main components and respectively analyzed, and TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.","title":"Thinking Like a Vertex: A Survey of Vertex-Centric Frameworks for Large-Scale Distributed Graph Processing","doi":"doi>10.1145/2818185"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"ryan","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444606734","last_name":"mccune","fist_name":"robert","full_name":"Robert Ryan Mccune"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658972101","last_name":"weninger","fist_name":"tim","full_name":"Tim Weninger"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100650823","last_name":"madey","fist_name":"greg","full_name":"Greg Madey"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Visible light LEDs, due to their numerous advantages, are expected to become the dominant indoor lighting technology.

Since finding an optimal schedule is an NP-complete problem in general, researchers have resorted to devising efficient heuristics. A plethora of heuristics have been proposed based on a wide spectrum of techniques, including branch-and-bound, integer-programming, searching, graph-theory, randomization, genetic algorithms, and evolutionary methods. The objective of this survey is to describe various scheduling algorithms and their functionalities in a contrasting fashion as well as examine their relative merits in terms of performance and time-complexity. Since these algorithms are based on diverse   assumptions, they differ in their functionalities, and hence are difficult to describe in a unified context. We propose a taxonomy that classifies these algorithms into different categories. We consider 27 scheduling algorithms, with each algorithm explained through an easy-to-understand description followed by an illustrative example to demonstrate its operation. We also outline some of the novel and promising optimization approaches and current research trends in the area.

This paper provides an overview of seventeen papers comprising a symposium on CSCW. The overview also discusses some relationships among the contributions made by each paper, and places those contributions into a larger context by identifying some of the key challenges faced by computer science researchers who aim to help us work effectively as teams mediated through networks of computers. The paper also describes why the promise of CSCW holds particular salience for the U.S military. In the context of a military setting, the paper describes five particular challenges for CSCW researchers. While most of these challenges might seem specific to military environments, many others probably  already face similar challenges, or soon will, when attempting to collaborate through networks of computers. To support this claim, the paper includes a military scenario that might hit fairly close to home for many, and certainly for civilian emergency response personnel. After discussing the military needs for collaboration technology, the paper briefly outlines the motivation for a recent DARPA research program along these lines. That program, called Intelligent Collaboration and Visualization, sponsored the work reported in this symposium.","title":"Introduction to the Electronic Symposium on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work","doi":"doi>10.1145/323216.323217"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This paper presents a framework for sharing JavaBeans applications in real-time synchronous collaboration.

This infrastructure captures the interactions between users (as video, text, audio and other data streams) and promotes a philosophy of filtering, archiving, and correlating collaborative sessions in user and context sensitive groupings. The semantic multicast service efficiently disseminates relevant information to every user engaged in the collaborative session, making the aggregated streams of the collaborative session available to the correct users at the right amount of detail. This contextual focus is accomplished by introducing proxy servers to gather,  annotate, and filter the streams appropriate for specific interest groups. Users are subscribed to appropriate proxies, based on their profiles, and the collaborative session becomes a multi-level multicast of data from sources through proxies and to user interest groups.","title":"Semantic multicast: intelligently sharing collaborative sessions","doi":"doi>10.1145/323216.323221"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100016453","last_name":"dao","fist_name":"son","full_name":"Son Dao"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342510958","last_name":"shek","fist_name":"eddie","full_name":"Eddie Shek"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100641209","last_name":"vellaikal","fist_name":"asha","full_name":"Asha Vellaikal"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100121357","last_name":"zhang","fist_name":"lixia","full_name":"Lixia Zhang"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100509456","last_name":"potkonjak","fist_name":"miodrag","full_name":"Miodrag Potkonjak"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Dynamic collaborator discovery in information intensive environments","doi":"doi>10.1145/323216.323355"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100151644","last_name":"payton","fist_name":"david","full_name":"David Payton"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100612554","last_name":"daily","fist_name":"mike","full_name":"Mike Daily"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Effective collaboration in fast-changing environment can put great dem ands on a collaborator's time. Therefore, information retrieval and filtering tools for these environments should impose as little on that time as possible. Not only should they exclude as many irrelevant documents as possible from those presented to the user (to avoid the time wasted sorting through and reading those documents), they should also minimize the user's effort in characterizing his or her information needs. The goal of the Task-based Information Distribution Environment (TIDE) system is to achieve these objectives by explicitly representing each collaborator's current task and using those representations to deliver documents that meet the information needs implied by those tasks. It does this by treating  information gathering as a diagnosis problem, in which the situation (i.e., the current state of beliefs about various questions related to a task) leads probabilistically to test that will provide the most evidence toward reaching a diagnosis (i.e., a description of the documents most likely to be useful to that task). It encodes tasks as nodes in a Bayesian network, and computes document descriptions based on the probabilistic relationship among tasks and their corresponding information requirements.","title":"Task-based information management","doi":"doi>10.1145/323216.323357"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100567606","last_name":"wolverton","fist_name":"michael","full_name":"Michael Wolverton"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"MASH: enabling scalable multipoint collaboration","doi":"doi>10.1145/323216.323220"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100453061","last_name":"mccanne","fist_name":"steven","full_name":"Steven Mccanne"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100357712","last_name":"brewer","fist_name":"eric","full_name":"Eric Brewer"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100505691","last_name":"amir","fist_name":"elan","full_name":"Elan Amir"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100295592","last_name":"chawathe","fist_name":"yatin","full_name":"Yatin Chawathe"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100276720","last_name":"hodes","fist_name":"todd","full_name":"Todd Hodes"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100041356","last_name":"mayer-patel","fist_name":"ketan","full_name":"Ketan Mayer-Patel"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100054359","last_name":"raman","fist_name":"suchitra","full_name":"Suchitra Raman"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100411898","last_name":"romer","fist_name":"cynthia","full_name":"Cynthia Romer"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100176553","last_name":"schuett","fist_name":"angela","full_name":"Angela Schuett"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81544685556","last_name":"swan","fist_name":"andrew","full_name":"Andrew Swan"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81538779456","last_name":"tung","fist_name":"teck-lee","full_name":"Teck-Lee Tung"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339537073","last_name":"wong","fist_name":"tina","full_name":"Tina Wong"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81542950056","last_name":"wright","fist_name":"kristin","full_name":"Kristin Wright"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This paper compares different indexing techniques proposed for supporting efficient access to temporal data.

When a number of methods have the same asymptotic worst-case behavior, features in the methods that affect average case behavior are discussed. Additional criteria examined are the pagination of an index, the ability to cluster related data together, and the ability to efficiently separate old from current data (so that larger archival storage media such as write-once optical disks can be  used).

But there has been only limited generalization of these ideas beyond classification, and many related attempts have been made in other disciplines (such as AI and operations research) to tackle the algorithm selection problem in different ways, introducing different terminology, and overlooking the similarities of approaches. In this sense, there is much to be gained from a greater awareness of developments in meta-learning, and how these ideas can be generalized to learn about the behaviors of other (nonlearning) algorithms. In this article we present a unified framework for considering the algorithm selection problem as a learning problem, and use this framework to tie together the crossdisciplinary developments in tackling the algorithm selection problem.

Recently, increasing interest is engaged in research to come up with solutions that provide wide-area autonomous surveillance systems for object characterization and situation awareness, which involves portable, wireless, and/or Internet connected radar, digital video, and/or infrared sensors. The prominent research problems associated with multisensor integration for wide-area surveillance are modality selection, sensor planning, data fusion, and data exchange (communication) among multiple sensors. Thus, the requirements and constraints to be addressed include far-field view, wide coverage, high resolution, cooperative sensors, adaptive sensing modalities, dynamic objects, and uncontrolled environments. This article summarizes a new survey and analysis conducted in light of these challenging requirements and constraints. It involves techniques and strategies from work done in the areas of sensor fusion, sensor networks, smart sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), photogrammetry, and other intelligent systems where finding optimal solutions to the placement and deployment of multimodal sensors covering a wide area is important. While techniques covered in this survey are applicable to many wide-area environments such as traffic monitoring, airport terminal surveillance, parking lot surveillance, etc., our examples will be drawn mainly from such applications as harbor security and long-range face recognition.","title":"Survey and analysis of multimodal sensor planning and integration for wide area surveillance","doi":"doi>10.1145/1456650.1456657"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"r","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100311034","last_name":"abidi","fist_name":"besma","full_name":"Besma R Abidi"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"r","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388602368","last_name":"aragam","fist_name":"nash","full_name":"Nash R Aragam"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309494693","last_name":"yao","fist_name":"yi","full_name":"Yi Yao"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"a","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100311123","last_name":"abidi","fist_name":"mongi","full_name":"Mongi A Abidi"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"We survey recent progress in software model checking.","title":"Software model checking","doi":"doi>10.1145/1592434.1592438"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100198278","last_name":"jhala","fist_name":"ranjit","full_name":"Ranjit Jhala"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100319213","last_name":"majumdar","fist_name":"rupak","full_name":"Rupak Majumdar"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Formal methods use mathematical models for analysis and verification at any part of the program life-cycle.

In traditional practice, many types of reorganization have required denying access to a database (taking the database offline) during reorganization. Taking a database offline can be unacceptable for a highly available (24-hour) database, for example, a database serving electronic commerce or armed forces, or for a very large database. A solution is to reorganize online (concurrently with usage of the database, incrementally during users' activities, or interpretively). This article is a tutorial and survey on requirements, issues, and strategies for online reorganization. It analyzes the issues and then presents the strategies, which use the issues. The issues, most of which involve design trade-offs, include use of partitions, the locus of control for the process that reorganizes (a background process or users' activities), reorganization by copying to newly allocated storage (as opposed to reorganizing in place), use of differential files, references to data that has moved, performance, and activation of reorganization. The article surveys online strategies in three categories of reorganization. The first category, maintenance, involves restoring the physical arrangement of data instances without changing the database definition. This category includes restoration of clustering, reorganization of an index, rebalancing of parallel or distributed data, garbage collection for persistent storage, and cleaning (reclamation of space) in a log-structured file system. The second category involves changing the physical database definition; topics include construction of indexes, conversion between B+-trees and linear hash files, and redefinition (e.g., splitting) of partitions. The third category involves changing the logical database definition. Some examples are changing a column's data type, changing the inheritance hierarchy of object classes, and changing a relationship from one-to-many to many-to-many. The survey encompasses both research and commercial implementations, and this article points out several open research topics. As highly available or very large databases continue to become more common and more important in the world economy, the importance of online reorganization is likely to continue growing.","title":"Online reorganization of databases","doi":"doi>10.1145/1541880.1541881"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"r","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100482796","last_name":"iyer","fist_name":"balakrishna","full_name":"Balakrishna R Iyer"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The literature provides a wide range of techniques to assess and improve the quality of data.

It is a characteristic that separates design of the interface from design of the computational component of an application system so that modifications in either tend not to cause changes in the other. The role of a dialogue developer, whose main purpose is to create quality interfaces, is a direct result of the dialogue independence concept.Structural models of the human-computer interfaceserve as frameworks for understanding the elements of interfaces and for guiding the dialogue developer in their construction.Representation of the human-computer interfaceis accomplished by a variety of notational schemes for describing the interface. Numerous kinds ofinteractive tools for human-computer interface developmentfree the dialogue developer from much of the tedium of \"coding\" dialogue.

Operationally, their model of computation consists of a dynamic set of concurrent processes, communicating by instantiating shared logical variables, synchronizing by waiting for variables to be instantiated, and making nondeterministic choices, possibly based on the availability of values of variables.This paper surveys the family of concurrent logic programming languages within a uniform operational framework. It demonstrates the expressive power of even the simplest language in the family and investigates how varying the basic synchronization and control constructs affect the expressiveness and efficiency of the resulting languages.In addition, the paper reports on techniques for sequential and parallel implementation of languages in this family, mentions their applications to date, and relates these languages to the abstract logic programming model, to the programming language PROLOG, and to other concurrent computational models and programming languages.","title":"The family of concurrent logic programming languages","doi":"doi>10.1145/72551.72555"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100431580","last_name":"shapiro","fist_name":"ehud","full_name":"Ehud Shapiro"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"When distributed systems first appeared, they were programmed in traditional sequential languages, usually with the addition of a few library procedures for sending and receiving messages.

These languages and their history, their underlying principles, their design, and their use are the subject of this paper.We begin by giving our view of what a distributed system is, illustrating with examples to avoid confusion on this important and controversial point. We then describe the three main characteristics that distinguish distributed programming languages from traditional sequential languages, namely, how they deal with parallelism, communication, and partial failures.

Their evolution is traced through several critical periods: early work on lambda calculus and combinatory calculus, Lisp, Iswim, FP, ML, and modern functional languages such as Miranda1and Haskell. The fundamental premises on which the functional programming methodology stands are critically analyzed with respect to philosophical, theoretical, and pragmatic concerns. Particular attention is paid to the main features that characterize modern functional languages: higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, equations and pattern matching, strong static typing and type inference, and data abstraction. In addition, current research areas—such as parallelism, nondeterminism, input/output, and state-oriented computations—are examined with the goal of predicting the future development and application of functional languages.","title":"Conception, evolution, and application of functional programming languages","doi":"doi>10.1145/72551.72554"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"We present a framework for parallel programming, based on three conceptual classes for understanding parallelism and three programming paradigms for implementing parallel programs. The conceptual classes are result parallelism, which centers on parallel computation of all elements in a data structure; agenda parallelism, which specifies an agenda of tasks for parallel execution; and specialist parallelism, in which specialist agents solve problems cooperatively. The programming paradigms center on live data structures that transform themselves into result data structures; distributed data structures that are accessible to many processes simultaneously; and message passing, in which all data objects are encapsulated within explicitly communicating processes. There is a rough correspondence between the conceptual classes and the programming methods, as we discuss. We begin by outlining the basic conceptual classes and programming paradigms, and by sketching an example solution under each of the three paradigms. The final section develops a simple example in greater detail, presenting and explaining code and discussing its performance on two commercial parallel computers, an 18-node shared-memory multiprocessor, and a 64-node distributed-memory hypercube. The middle section bridges the gap between the abstract and the practical by giving an overview of how the basic paradigms are implemented.We focus on the paradigms, not on machine architecture or programming languages: The programming methods we discuss are useful on many kinds of parallel machine, and each can be expressed in several different parallel programming languages. Our programming discussion and the examples use the parallel language C-Linda for several reasons: The main paradigms are all simple to express in Linda; efficient Linda implementations exist on a wide variety of parallel machines; and a wide variety of parallel programs have been written in Linda.","title":"How to write parallel programs: a guide to the perplexed","doi":"doi>10.1145/72551.72553"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410596030","last_name":"carriero","fist_name":"nicholas","full_name":"Nicholas Carriero"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100544609","last_name":"gelernter","fist_name":"david","full_name":"David Gelernter"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The theory of combinatorial designs has been used in widely different areas of computation concerned with the design and analysis of both algorithms and hardware.

EBL systems are characterized by the ability to create justified generalizations from single training instances. They are also distinguished by their reliance on background knowledge of the domain under study. Although EBL is usually viewed as a method for performing generalization, it can be viewed in other ways as well. In particular, EBL can be seen as a method that performs four different learning tasks: generalization, chunking, operationalization, and analogy.This paper provides a general introduction to the field of explanation-based learning. Considerable emphasis is placed on showing how EBL combines the four learning tasks mentioned above. The paper begins with a presentation of an intuitive example of the EBL technique. Subsequently EBL is placed in its historical context and the relation between EBL and other areas of machine learning is described. The major part of this paper is a survey of selected EBL programs, which have been chosen to show how EBL manifests each of the four learning tasks. Attempts to formalize the EBL technique are also briefly discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of EBL and the major open questions in the field.","title":"Explanation-based learning: a survey of programs and perspectives","doi":"doi>10.1145/66443.66445"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100203752","last_name":"ellman","fist_name":"thomas","full_name":"Thomas Ellman"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Computer games have been around for almost as long as computers.

Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines    are identified.

Transformations for both sequential and various types of parallel architectures are covered in depth. We describe the purpose of each transformation, explain how to determine if it is legal, and give an example of its application.Programmers wishing to enhance the performance of their code can use this survey to improve their understanding of the optimizations that compilers can perform, or as a reference for techniques to be applied manually.

One approach to this problem is to utilize parallel processing, taking advantage of the concurrency available in the VLSI system to accelerate the logic simulation task.Parallel logic simulation has received a great deal of attention over the past several years, but this work has not yet resulted in effective, high-performance simulators being available to  VLSI designers. A number of techniques have been developed to investigate performance issues: formal models, performance modeling, empirical studies, and prototype implementations.

We present a detailed survey of various techniques for enhancing the performance and reliability of wormhole-routing schemes in directly connected networks. We start with an overview of the direct network topologies and a comparison of various switching techniques. Next, the characteristics of the wormhole routing mechanism are described in detail along with the theory behind deadlock-free routing. The performance of routing algorithms depends on the selection of the path between the source and the destination, the network traffic, and the router design. The routing algorithms are implemented in the router chips. We outline the router characteristics and describe the  functionality of various elements of the router. Depending on the usage of paths between the source and the destination, routing algorithms are classified as deterministic, fully adaptive, and partially adaptive. We discuss several representative algorithms for all these categories. The algorithms within each category vary in terms of resource requirements and performance under various traffic conditions. The main difference among various adaptive routing schemes is the technique used to avoid deadlocks. We also discuss a few algorithms based on deadlock recovery techniques. Along with performance, fault tolerance is essential for message routing in multicomputers, and we thus discuss several fault-tolerant wormhole routing algorithms along with their fault-handling capabilities. These  routing schemes enable a message to reach its destination even in the presence of faults in the network. The implementation details of wormhole routing algorithms in contemporary commercial systems are also discussed. We conclude by itemizing several future directions and open issues.","title":"Wormhole routing techniques for directly connected multicomputer systems","doi":"doi>10.1145/292469.292472"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100262895","last_name":"mohapatra","fist_name":"prasant","full_name":"Prasant Mohapatra"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Internet programming languages such as Java present new challenges to garbage-collection design.

We argue that an ideal model should by easy to program, should have a software development methodology, should be architecture-independent, should be easy to understand, should guarantee performance, and should provide accurate information about the cost of programs. These criteria reflect our belief that developments in parallelism must be driven by a parallel software industry based on portability and efficiency. We consider programming models in six categories, depending on the level of abstraction they provide. Those that are very abstract conceal even the presence of parallelism at the software level. Such models make software easy to  build and port, but efficient and predictable performance is usually hard to achieve. At the other end of the spectrum, low-level models make all of the messy issues of parallel programming explicit (how many threads, how to place them, how to express communication, and how to schedule communication), so that software is hard to build and not very portable, but is usually efficient. Most recent models are near the center of this spectrum, exploring the best tradeoffs between expressiveness and performance. A few models have achieved both abstractness and efficiency. Both kinds of models raise the possibility of parallelism as part of the mainstream of computing.","title":"Models and languages for parallel computation","doi":"doi>10.1145/280277.280278"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"b","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452608878","last_name":"skillicorn","fist_name":"david","full_name":"David B Skillicorn"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100624391","last_name":"talia","fist_name":"domenico","full_name":"Domenico Talia"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Search operations in databases require special support at the physical level.

It starts with a discussion on providing fault tolerance in a system in which processes simply fail. For this purpose, we first identify two basic requirements for fault-tolerant mobile agent execution: (1) non-blocking (i.e., a single failure does not prevent progress of the mobile agent execution) and (2) exactly-once (i.e., multiple executions of the agent are prevented). This leads us to introduce the notion of a <i>local transaction</i> as the basic building block for fault-tolerant mobile agent execution and to classify existing approaches according to when and by whom the local transactions are committed. In a second part, we show that transactional mobile agent execution additionally ensures execution atomicity and present a survey of existing approaches. In the last part of the survey, we extend the notion of fault tolerance to arbitrary Byzantine failures and security-related issues of the mobile agent execution.","title":"Approaches to fault-tolerant and transactional mobile agent execution---an algorithmic view","doi":"doi>10.1145/1035570.1035571"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100349665","last_name":"pleisch","fist_name":"stefan","full_name":"Stefan Pleisch"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The article aims to introduce computer scientists to the new field of bioinformatics.

Some of these categories are further divided into subcategories. We have also created tables to compare the papers in each category against such criteria as dimensionality, input type, preprocessing, user interaction, and result type.","title":"A review of vessel extraction techniques and algorithms","doi":"doi>10.1145/1031120.1031121"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100627423","last_name":"kirbas","fist_name":"cemil","full_name":"Cemil Kirbas"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100361835","last_name":"quek","fist_name":"francis","full_name":"Francis Quek"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An overview is presented of object-based and image-based representations of objects by their interiors. The representations are distinguished by the manner in which they can be used to answer two fundamental queries in database applications: (1) Feature query: given an object, determine its constituent cells (i.e., their locations in space). (2) Location query: given a cell (i.e., a location in space), determine the identity of the object (or objects) of which it is a member as well as the remaining constituent cells of the object (or objects). Regardless of the representation that is used, the generation of responses to the feature and location queries is facilitated by building an index (i.e., the result of a sort) either on the objects or on their locations in space, and implementing it using an access structure that correlates the objects with the locations. Assuming the presence of an access structure, implicit (i.e., image-based) representations are described that are good for finding the objects associated with a particular location or cell (i.e., the location query), while requiring that all cells be examined when determining the locations associated with a particular object (i.e., the feature query). In contrast, explicit (i.e., object-based) representations are good for the feature query, while requiring that all objects be examined when trying to respond to the location query. The goal is to be able to answer both types of queries with one representation and without possibly having to examine every cell. Representations are presented that achieve this goal by imposing containment hierarchies on either space (i.e., the cells in the space in which the objects are found), or objects. In the former case, space is aggregated into successively larger-sized chunks (i.e., blocks), while in the latter, objects are aggregated into successively larger groups (in terms of the number of objects that they contain). The former is applicable to image-based interior-based representations of which the space pyramid is an example. The latter is applicable to object-based interior-based representations of which the R-tree is an example. The actual mechanics of many of these representations are demonstrated in the VASCO JAVA applets found at http://www.cs.umd.edu/˜hjs/quadtree/index.html.","title":"Object-based and image-based object

ineffectiveness of information retrieval systems is largely caused by the inaccuracy with which a query formed by a few keywords models the actual user information need. One well known method to overcome this limitation is automatic query expansion (AQE), whereby the user’s original query is augmented by new features with a similar meaning. AQE has a long history in the information retrieval community but it is only in the last years that it has reached a level of scientific and experimental maturity, especially in laboratory settings such as TREC. This survey presents a unified view of a large number of recent approaches to AQE that leverage various data sources and employ very different principles and techniques. The following questions are addressed. Why is query expansion so important to improve search effectiveness? What are the main steps involved in the design and implementation of an AQE component? What approaches to AQE are available and how do they compare? Which issues must still be resolved before AQE becomes a standard component of large operational information retrieval systems (e.g., search engines)?","title":"A Survey of Automatic Query Expansion in Information Retrieval","doi":"doi>10.1145/2071389.2071390"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADBuy this ArticlePDF (357 KB)APPENDICES and SUPPLEMENTSa3-nielson_appendix.pdf \r\n                 \r\n                The proof is given in an electronic appendix, available online in the ACM Digital Library.","title":"Flow Logic for Process Calculi","doi":"doi>10.1145/2071389.2071392"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100469410","last_name":"pilegaard","fist_name":"henrik","full_name":"Henrik Pilegaard"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The following flow-oriented architectures for quality of service assurance in IP networks are surveyed: Integrated Services, Connectionless Approach to QoS guarantees, Dynamic Packet State, Caspian Networks and Anagran, the Feedback and Distribution method, Flow-Based Differentiated Services, Flow-Aware Networking, the Flow-State-Aware transport, and Flow-Aggregate-Based services.

The purpose of this article is to provide an updated survey of palmprint recognition methods, and present a comparative study to evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art palmprint recognition methods. Using the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU) palmprint database (version 2), we compare the recognition performance of a number of holistic-based (Fisherpalms and DCT+LDA) and local feature-based (competitive code, ordinal code, robust line orientation code, derivative of Gaussian code, and wide line detector) methods, and then investigate the error correlation and score-level fusion performance of different algorithms.

We categorize thermal management techniques into six main categories: temperature monitoring, microarchitectural techniques, floorplanning, OS/compiler techniques, liquid cooling techniques, and thermal reliability/security. Temperature monitoring, a requirement for Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM), includes temperature estimation and sensor placement techniques for accurate temperature measurement or estimation. Microarchitectural techniques include both static and dynamic thermal management techniques that control hardware structures. Floorplanning covers a range of thermal-aware floorplanning techniques for 2D and 3D microprocessors. OS/compiler techniques include thermal-aware task scheduling and instruction scheduling techniques. Liquid cooling techniques are higher-capacity alternatives to conventional air cooling techniques. Thermal reliability/security issues cover temperature-dependent reliability modeling, Dynamic Reliability Management (DRM), and malicious codes that specifically cause overheating. Temperature-related issues will only become more challenging as process technology continues to evolve and transistor densities scale up faster than power per transistor scales down.

rising abuse of computers and increasing threat to personal privacy through data banks have stimulated much interest in the technical safeguards for data. There are four kinds of safeguards, each related to but distinct from the others. Access controls regulate which users may enter the system and subsequently which data sets an active user may read or write. Flow controls regulate the dissemination of values among the data sets accessible to a user. Inference controls protect statistical databases by preventing questioners from deducing confidential information by posing carefully designed sequences of statistical queries and correlating the responses. Statistical data banks are much less secure than most people believe. Data encryption attempts to prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in transit or in storage. This paper describes the general nature of controls of each type, the kinds of problems they can and cannot solve, and their inherent limitations and weaknesses.

A serious problem of these indexes has traditionally been their space consumption. A recent trend is to develop indexes that exploit the compressibility of the text, so that their size is a function of the compressed text length. This concept has evolved intoself-indexes, which in addition contain enough information to reproduce any text portion, so theyreplacethe text. The exciting possibility of an index that takes space close to that of the compressed text, replaces it, and in addition provides fast search over it, has triggered a wealth of activity and produced surprising results in a very short time, which radically changed the status of this area in less than 5 years. The most successful indexes nowadays are able to obtain almost optimal space and search time simultaneously.In this article we present the main concepts underlying (compressed) self-indexes. We explain the relationship between text entropy and regularities that show up in index structures and permit compressing them. Then we cover the most relevant self-indexes, focusing on how they exploit text compressibility to achieve compact structures that can efficiently solve various search problems.

Naive implementation methods that compute each node separately and store the result are impractical, since they have exponential time and space complexity with respect to the cube dimensionality. To overcome this drawback, a wide range of methods that provide efficient cube implementation (with respect to both computation and storage) have been proposed, which make use of relational, multidimensional, or graph-based data structures. Furthermore, there are several other methods that compute and store approximate descriptions of data cubes, sacrificing accuracy for condensation. In this article, we focus on Relational-OLAP (ROLAP), following the majority of the efforts so far. We review existing ROLAP methods that implement the data cube and identify six orthogonal parameters/dimensions that characterize them. We place the existing techniques at the appropriate points within the problem space defined by these parameters and identify several clusters that the techniques form with various interesting properties. A careful study of these properties leads to the identification of particularly effective values for the space parameters and indicates the potential for devising new algorithms with better overall performance.","title":"ROLAP implementations of the data cube","doi":"doi>10.1145/1287620.1287623"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318495518","last_name":"morfonios","fist_name":"konstantinos","full_name":"Konstantinos Morfonios"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339509991","last_name":"konakas","fist_name":"stratis","full_name":"Stratis Konakas"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029318","last_name":"kotsis","fist_name":"nikolaos","full_name":"Nikolaos Kotsis"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Ontologies, as sets of concepts and their interrelations in a specific domain, have proven to be a useful tool in the areas of digital libraries, the semantic web, and personalized information management.

From a research perspective, this enables the networking community to concurrently experiment with new Internet architectures and protocols. From a market perspective, on the other hand, this paradigm is appealing as it enables infrastructure service providers to experiment with new business models that range from leasing virtual slices of their infrastructure to hosting multiple concurrent network services.In this article, we present the slice embedding problem and recent developments in the area. A slice is a set of virtual instances spanning a set of physical resources. The embedding problem consists of three main tasks: (1) resource discovery, which involves monitoring the state of the physical resources, (2) virtual network mapping, which involves matching users' requests with the available resources, and (3) allocation, which involves assigning the resources that match the users' requests.We also outline how these three tasks are tightly coupled, and how there exists a wide spectrum of solutions that either solve a particular task or jointly solve multiple tasks along with the interactions among them. To dissect the space of solutions, we introduce three main classification criteria, namely: (1) the type of constraints imposed by the user, (2) the type of dynamics considered in the embedding process, and (3) the allocation strategy adopted. Finally, we conclude with a few interesting research directions.","title":"Slice embedding solutions for distributed service architectures","doi":"doi>10.1145/2522968.2522974"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81372592538","last_name":"esposito","fist_name":"flavio","full_name":"Flavio Esposito"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100587208","last_name":"matta","fist_name":"ibrahim","full_name":"Ibrahim Matta"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474700087","last_name":"ishakian","fist_name":"vatche","full_name":"Vatche Ishakian"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Scalability, fast response time, and low cost are of utmost importance in designing a successful massively multiplayer online game.

Peer-to-peer architectures, due to their distributed and collaborative nature, have low infrastructure costs and can achieve high scalability. They can also achieve fast response times by creating direct connections between players. However, these architectures face many challenges. Distributing a game among peers makes maintaining control over the game more complex. Peer-to-peer architectures also tend to be vulnerable to churn and cheating. Moreover, different genres of games have different requirements that should be met by the underlying architecture, rendering the task of designing a general-purpose architecture harder.

The detection of the road borders, the estimation of the road geometry, and the localization of the vehicle are essential tasks in this context since they are required for the lateral and longitudinal control of the vehicle. Within this field, on-board vision has been widely used since it has many advantages (higher resolution, low power consumption, low cost, easy aesthetic integration, and nonintrusive nature) over other active sensors such as RADAR or LIDAR. At first glance the problem of detecting the road geometry from visual information seems simple and early works in this field were quickly rewarded with promising results.

As a result, numerous vulnerabilities exist at every level of the software stack. Three general approaches have evolved to rectify this problem. The most popular approach is based on complexhardware enhancements; this allows all encryption and decryption to be conducted within a well-defined trusted boundary. Unfortunately, these designs have not been integrated within commodity processors and have primarily been explored through simulation with very few prototypes. An alternative approach has been to augment existing hardware withoperating system enhancementsfor manipulating keys, providing improved trust. This approach has provided insights into the use of encryption but has involved unacceptable overheads and has not been adopted in commercial operating systems. Finally,specialized industrial deviceshave evolved, potentially adding coprocessors, to increase security of particular operations in specific operating environments. However, this approach lacks generality and has introduced unexpected vulnerabilities of its own. Recently, memory encryption primitives have been integrated within commodity processors such as the Intel i7, AMD bulldozer, and multiple ARM variants. This opens the door for new operating system designs that provide confidentiality across the entire software stack outside the CPU. To date, little practical experimentation has been conducted, and the improvements in security and associated performance degradation has yet to be quantified.

However, for Dynamic Multi-Objective Optimisation (DMOO), no standard benchmark functions are used. A number of DMOOPs have been proposed in recent years. However, no comprehensive overview of DMOOPs exist in the literature. Therefore, choosing which benchmark functions to use is not a trivial task. This article seeks to address this gap in the DMOO literature by providing a comprehensive overview of proposed DMOOPs, and proposing characteristics that an ideal DMOO benchmark function suite should exhibit. In addition, DMOOPs are proposed for each characteristic. Shortcomings of current DMOOPs that do not address certain characteristics of an ideal benchmark suite are highlighted. These identified shortcomings are addressed by proposing new DMOO benchmark functions with complicated Pareto-Optimal Sets (POSs), and approaches to develop DMOOPs with either an isolated or deceptive Pareto-Optimal Front (POF). In addition, DMOO application areas and real-world DMOOPs are discussed.","title":"Benchmarks for dynamic multi-objective optimisation algorithms","doi":"doi>10.1145/2517649"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87258608357","last_name":"helbig","fist_name":"marde","full_name":"Marde Helbig"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"p","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100188464","last_name":"engelbrecht","fist_name":"andries","full_name":"Andries P Engelbrecht"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"In the virtualization area, replication has been considered as a mechanism to provide high availability.

Full verification generally requires, as a crucial step, equipping each loop with a “loop invariant.” Beyond their role in verification, loop invariants help program understanding by providing fundamental insights into the nature of algorithms. In practice, finding sound and useful invariants remains a challenge. Fortunately, many invariants seem intuitively to exhibit a common flavor. Understanding these fundamental invariant patterns could therefore provide help for understanding and verifying a large variety of programs.We performed a systematic identification, validation, and classification of loop invariants over a range of fundamental algorithms from diverse areas of computer science. This article analyzes the patterns, as uncovered in this study, governing how invariants are derived from postconditions; it proposes a taxonomy of invariants according to these patterns; and it presents its application to the algorithms reviewed. The discussion also shows the need for high-level specifications based on “domain theory.” It describes how the invariants and the corresponding algorithms have been mechanically verified using an automated program prover; the proof source files are available. The contributions also include suggestions for invariant inference and for model-based specification.","title":"Loop invariants: Analysis, classification, and examples","doi":"doi>10.1145/2506375"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550555056","last_name":"meyer","fist_name":"bertrand","full_name":"Bertrand Meyer"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87259425057","last_name":"velder","fist_name":"sergey","full_name":"Sergey Velder"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Timed automata are state-machine-like structures used to model real-time systems.

For instance, users are notified of articles in which they are interested through RSS feeds, of posts from their friends through social networks, or of recommendation generated by various sites. Event notification usually relies on the so-called Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) communication paradigm. In Pub/Subsystems, subscribers sign up for events or classes of events in order to be asynchronously notified afterward by the system. The size of such systems (with respect to events and subscriptions) keeps growing, and providing scalable implementations of Pub/Subsystems is extremely challenging. Although there exist popular examples of centralized Pub/Subsystems that currently support a large number of subscribers, such as online social networks, they periodically face formidable challenges due to peak loads and do not always offer a support for fine-grain subscriptions. In fact, providing scalability along with expressiveness in the subscription patterns calls for distributed implementations of Pub/Subsystems. In parallel, peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks have emerged, providing a sound and highly scalable network foundation upon which to build distributed applications including Pub/Subsystems.In this article, we focus on fully decentralized (P2P), highly scalable, Pub/Subsystems.

It seeks to facilitate the inquiry into the following question: “What is possible in m-learning using recent technologies&quest;” The analysis will be divided into two main parts: applications from the recent online mobile stores and operating system standalone applications.","title":"Survey and analysis of current mobile learning applications and technologies","doi":"doi>10.1145/2543581.2543594"}]},{"row":[{"link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81464649319"}]},{"row":[{"link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100007093"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADBuy this ArticlePDF (285 KB)APPENDICES and SUPPLEMENTSa28-herraiz-apndx.pdf \r\n                 \r\n                Supplemental movie, appendix, image and software files for, The evolution of the laws of software evolution: A discussion based on a systematic literature review","title":"The evolution of the laws of software evolution: A discussion based on a systematic literature review","doi":"doi>10.1145/2543581.2543595"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337888","last_name":"herraiz","fist_name":"israel","full_name":"Israel Herraiz"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81498657226","last_name":"rodriguez","fist_name":"daniel","full_name":"Daniel Rodriguez"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330496858","last_name":"robles","fist_name":"gregorio","full_name":"Gregorio Robles"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"m","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100179070","last_name":"gonzalez-barahona","fist_name":"jesus","full_name":"Jesus M Gonzalez-Barahona"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Vehicles equipped with GPS localizers are an important sensory device for examining people’s movements and activities. Taxis equipped with GPS localizers serve the transportation needs of a large number of people driven by diverse needs; their traces can tell us where passengers were picked up and dropped off, which route was taken, and what steps the driver took to find a new passenger. In this article, we provide an exhaustive survey of the work on mining these traces. We first provide a formalization of the data sets, along with an overview of different mechanisms for preprocessing the data. We then classify the existing work into three main categories: social dynamics, traffic dynamics and operational dynamics. Social dynamics refers to the study of the collective behaviour of a city’s population, based on their observed movements; Traffic dynamics studies the resulting flow of the movement through the road network; Operational dynamics refers to the study and analysis of taxi driver’smodus operandi. We discuss the different problems currently being researched, the various approaches proposed, and suggest new avenues of research. Finally, we present a historical overview of the research work in this field and discuss which areas hold most promise for future research.","title":"From taxi GPS traces to social and community dynamics: A survey","doi":"doi>10.1145/2543581.2543584"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"samuel","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548006560","last_name":"castro","fist_name":"pablo","full_name":"Pablo Samuel Castro"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84458610757","last_name":"zhang","fist_name":"daqing","full_name":"Daqing Zhang"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158820757","last_name":"chen","fist_name":"chao","full_name":"Chao Chen"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86159010857","last_name":"li","fist_name":"shijian","full_name":"Shijian Li"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100484528","last_name":"pan","fist_name":"gang","full_name":"Gang Pan"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The adequacy of a programming language to a given software project or application domain is often considered a key factor of success in software development and engineering, even though little theoretical or practical information is readily available to help make an informed decision. In this article, we address a particular version of this issue by comparing the adequacy of general-purpose synchronous programming languages to more Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in the field of computer music. More precisely, we implemented and tested the same lookup table oscillator example program, one of the most classical algorithms for sound synthesis, using a selection of significant synchronous programming languages, half of which designed as specific music languages—Csound, Pure Data, SuperCollider, ChucK, Faust—and the other half being general synchronous formalisms—Signal, Lustre, Esterel, Lucid Synchrone and C with the OpenMP Stream Extension (Matlab/Octave is used for the initial specification). The advantages of these two approaches are discussed, providing insights to language designers and possibly software developers of both communities regarding programming languages design for the audio domain.","title":"Synchronous programming in audio processing: A lookup table oscillator case study","doi":"doi>10.1145/2543581.2543591"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=84460646957","last_name":"barkati","fist_name":"karim","full_name":"Karim Barkati"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100056957","last_name":"jouvelot","fist_name":"pierre","full_name":"Pierre Jouvelot"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"In this survey article, we present open problems and conjectures on visibility graphs of points, segments, and polygons along with necessary backgrounds for understanding them.","title":"Unsolved problems in visibility graphs of points, segments, and polygons","doi":"doi>10.1145/2543581.2543589"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"k","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408592187","last_name":"ghosh","fist_name":"subir","full_name":"Subir K Ghosh"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"p","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100307086","last_name":"goswami","fist_name":"partha","full_name":"Partha P Goswami"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADBuy this ArticlePDF (215 KB)APPENDICES and SUPPLEMENTSa19-csapo-apndx.pdf \r\n                 \r\n                Supplemental movie, appendix, image and software files for, Overview of auditory representations in human-machine interfaces","title":"Overview of auditory representations in human-machine interfaces","doi":"doi>10.1145/2543581.2543586"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453652119","last_name":"csapo","fist_name":"adam","full_name":"Adam Csapo"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447603966","last_name":"wersenyi","fist_name":"gyorgy","full_name":"Gyorgy Wersenyi"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The spatial features of emitted wireless signals are the basis of location distinction and determination for wireless indoor localization. Available in mainstream wireless signal measurements, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) has been adopted in vast indoor localization systems. However, it suffers from dramatic performance degradation in complex situations due to multipath fading and temporal dynamics.Break-through techniques resort to finer-grained wireless channel measurement than RSSI. Different from RSSI, the PHY layer power feature, channel response, is able to discriminate multipath characteristics, and thus holds the potential for the convergence of accurate and pervasive indoor localization. Channel State Information (CSI, reflecting channel response in 802.11 a/g/n) has attracted many research efforts and some pioneer works have demonstrated submeter or even centimeter-level accuracy. In this article, we survey this new trend of channel response in localization. The differences between CSI and RSSI are highlighted with respect to network layering, time resolution, frequency resolution, stability, and accessibility. Furthermore, we investigate a large body of recent works and classify them overall into three categories according to how to use CSI. For each category, we emphasize the basic principles and address future directions of research in this new and largely open area.","title":"From RSSI to CSI: Indoor localization via channel response","doi":"doi>10.1145/2543581.2543592"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158681457","last_name":"yang","fist_name":"zheng","full_name":"Zheng Yang"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548024498","last_name":"liu","fist_name":"yunhao","full_name":"Yunhao Liu"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Steganography is an ancient art that encompasses various techniques of information hiding, the aim of which is to embed secret information into a carrier message.

Moreover, since the 1980s grammars have been used in computer vision and related areas.

The objective of this article is to present an overview regarding the use of syntactic pattern recognition methods in image representations in several applications. To achieve this purpose, we used a systematic review process to investigate the main digital libraries in the area and to document the phases of the study in order to allow the auditing and further investigation. The results indicated that in some of the studies retrieved, manually created grammars were used to comply with a particular purpose. Other studies performed a learning process of the grammatical rules.

The merit of pipelining is that it can help to match the speeds of various subsystems without duplicating the cost of the entire system involved. As technology evolves, faster and cheaper LSI circuits become available, and the future of pipelining, either in a simple or complex form, becomes more promising.This paper reviews the many theoretical considerations and problems behind pipelining, surveying and comparing various representative pipeline machines that operate in either sequential or vector pipeline mode, the practical solutions adopted, and the tradeoffs involved. The performance of a simple pipe, the physical speed limitation, and the control structures for penalty-incurring events are analyzed separately. The problems faced by the system designers are tackled, including buffering, busing structur, branching, and interrupt handling. Aspects of sequential and vector processing are studied. Fundamental advantages of vector processing are unveiled, and additional requirements (costs) are discussed to establish a criterion for the tradeoff between sequential and vector pipeline processing. Finally, two recent machines (the CRAY-1 and the Amdahl 470 V/6 systems) are presented to demonstrate how complex pipeline techniques can be used and how simple but advantageous pipeline concepts can be exploited.","title":"Pipeline Architecture","doi":"doi>10.1145/356683.356687"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Associative Processor Architecture—a

The origins of spoken dialogue systems can be traced back to Artificial Intelligence research in the 1950s concerned with developing conversational interfaces. However, it is only within the last decade or so, with major advances in speech technology, that large-scale working systems have been developed and, in some cases, introduced into commercial environments. As a result many major telecommunications and software companies have become aware of the potential for spoken dialogue technology to provide solutions in newly developing areas such as computer-telephony integration. Voice portals, which provide a speech-based interface between a telephone user and Web-based services, are the most recent application of spoken dialogue technology. This article describes the main components of the technology---speech recognition, language understanding, dialogue management, communication with an external source such as a database, language generation, speech synthesis---and shows how these component technologies can be integrated into a spoken dialogue system. The article describes in detail the methods that have been adopted in some well-known dialogue systems, explores different system architectures, considers issues of specification, design, and evaluation, reviews some currently available dialogue development toolkits, and outlines prospects for future development.","title":"Spoken dialogue technology: enabling the conversational user interface","doi":"doi>10.1145/505282.505285"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"f","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100559155","last_name":"mctear","fist_name":"michael","full_name":"Michael F Mctear"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Frequently a user's information needs are stored in the databases of multiple search engines. It is inconvenient and inefficient for an ordinary user to invoke multiple search engines and identify useful documents from the returned results. To support unified access to multiple search engines, a metasearch engine can be constructed. When a metasearch engine receives a query from a user, it invokes the underlying search engines to retrieve useful information for the user. Metasearch engines have other benefits as a search tool such as increasing the search coverage of the Web and improving the scalability of the search. In this article, we survey techniques that have been proposed to tackle several underlying challenges for building a good metasearch engine. Among the main challenges, the database selection problem is to identify search engines that are likely to return useful documents to a given query. The document selection problem is to determine what documents to retrieve from each identified search engine. The result merging problem is to combine the documents returned from multiple search engines. We will also point out some problems that need to be further researched.","title":"Building efficient and effective metasearch engines","doi":"doi>10.1145/505282.505284"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100222888","last_name":"meng","fist_name":"weiyi","full_name":"Weiyi Meng"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452593046","last_name":"liu","fist_name":"king-lup","full_name":"King-Lup Liu"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm.

A uniform and consistent combination of object orientation and database programming, however, is not straightforward. Since one of the main components of an object-oriented programming language is its type system, one of the first problems that arises during an OODBPL design is related to the development of a uniform, consistent, and theoretically sound type system that is sufficiently expressive to satisfy the combined needs of object orientation and database programming.The purpose of this article is to answer two questions: \"What are the requirements that a modern type system for an object-oriented database programming language should satisfy?\" and \"Are there any type systems developed to-date that satisfy these requirements?\". In order to answer the first question, we compile the set of requirements that an OODBPL type system should satisfy. We then use this set of requirements to evaluate more than 30 existing type systems. The result of this extensive analysis shows that while each of the requirements is satisfied by at least one type system, no type system satisfies all of them. It also enables identification of the mechanisms that lie behind the strengths and weaknesses of the current type systems.","title":"On type systems for object-oriented database programming languages","doi":"doi>10.1145/592642.592643"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100017649","last_name":"leontiev","fist_name":"yuri","full_name":"Yuri Leontiev"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100405412","last_name":"szafron","fist_name":"duane","full_name":"Duane Szafron"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This article is a survey of research areas in which motion plays a pivotal role.

the three-dimensional motion of objects, relative to a visual sensor, onto its image plane. Sequences of time-orderedimages allow the estimation of projected two-dimensional image motion as either instantaneous image velocities or discrete image displacements. These are usually called theoptical flow fieldor theimage velocity field. Provided that optical flow is a reliable approximation to two-dimensional image motion, it may then be used to recover the three-dimensional motion of the visual sensor (to within a scale factor) and the three-dimensional surface structure (shape or relative depth) through assumptions concerning the structure of the optical flow field, the three-dimensional environment, and the motion of the sensor. Optical flow may also be used to perform motion detection, object segmentation, time-to-collision and focus of expansion calculations, motion compensated encoding, and stereo disparity measurement. We investigate the computation of optical flow in this survey: widely known methods for estimating optical flow are classified and examined by scrutinizing the hypothesis and assumptions they use.

Because the time spent in loop execution dominates total execution time, a large body of optimizations focuses on decreasing the time to execute each iteration. Software pipelining is a technique that reforms the loop so that a faster execution rate is realized. Iterations are executed in overlapped fashion to increase parallelism.Let {ABC}nrepresent a loop containing operationsA, B, Cthat is executedntimes. Although the operations of a single iteration can be parallelized, more parallelism may be achieved if the entire loop is considered rather than a single iteration. The software pipelining transformation utilizes the fact that a loop {ABC}nis equivalent toA{BCA}n−1BC.

It can be used in CAD/CAM for evaluation of designs, in computer vision for machine recognition and machine inspection of objects, and in intelligent manufacturing for automating and integrating the link between design and manufacturing. This topic has been an active area of research since the late '70s, and a significant number of computational methods have been proposed to identify portions of the geometry of a part having engineering significance (here called “features”). However, each proposed mechanism has been able to solve the problem only for components within a restricted geometric domain (such as polyhedral   components), or only for components whose features interact with each other in a restricted manner. The purposes of this article are to review and summarize the development of research on machine recognition of features from CAD data, to discuss the advantages and potential problems of each approach, and to point out some of the promising directions future investigations may take. Since most work in this field has focused on machining features, the article primarily covers those features associated with the manufacturing domain. In order to better understand the state of the art, methods of automated feature recognition are divided into the following categories of methods based on their approach: graph-based, syntactic pattern recognition, rule-based, and volumetric. Within each category  we have studied issues such as the definition of features, mechanisms developed for recognition of features, the application scope, and the assumptions made. In addition, the problem is addressed from the perspective of information input requirements and the advantages and disadvantages of boundary representation, constructive solid geometry (CSG), and 2D drawings with respect to machine recognition of features are examined. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms for attacking problems associated with interacting features.","title":"Machine interpretation of CAD data for manufacturing applications","doi":"doi>10.1145/262009.262012"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100388732","last_name":"ji","fist_name":"qiang","full_name":"Qiang Ji"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"m","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100381037","last_name":"marefat","fist_name":"michael","full_name":"Michael M Marefat"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Sun's announcement of the programming language Java more that anything popularized the notion of mobile code, that is, programs traveling on a heterogeneous network and automatically executing upon arrival at the destination.

Shared resource contention can lead to severe and unpredictable performance impact on the threads running on the CMP. Conversely, CMPs offer tremendous opportunities for mulithreaded applications, which can take advantage of simultaneous thread execution as well as fast inter thread data sharing. Many solutions have been proposed to deal with the negative aspects of CMPs and take advantage of the positive. This survey focuses on the subset of these solutions that exclusively make use of OS thread-level scheduling to achieve their goals. These solutions are particularly attractive as they require no changes to hardware and minimal or no changes to the OS.

Sensor nodes, are autonomous nodes, which include smart dust sensors, motes and so on. They co-operatively monitor physical or environmental conditions and send the sensed data to the sink node. They differ from traditional computer networks due to resource constraints, unbalanced mixture traffic, data redundancy, network dynamics, and energy balance. These kinds of networks support a wide range of applications that have strong requirements to reduce end-to-end delay and losses during data transmissions. When large numbers of sensors are deployed in a sensor field and are active in transmitting the data, there is a possibility of congestion. Congestion may occur due to buffer overflow, channel contention, packet collision, a high data rate, many to one nature, and so on. This leads to packet loss which causes a decrease in throughput and lifetime. Maximum throughput, energy efficiency and minimum error rate can be achieved by minimizing the congestion. A number of quality of service (QoS) techniques has been developed to improve the quality of the network. This article gives an overview of existing QoS techniques and a parametric comparison made with recent developments.

Drawing from established disciplines of manufacturing, SPL approaches aim to design repertoires of software artifacts, from which customized software systems for specific stakeholder requirements can be developed. A major difficulty SPL approaches attempt to address is the modularization of software artifacts, which reconciles the user's needs for certain features and the development and technical constraints. Towards this end, many SPL approaches use feature diagrams to describe possible configurations of a feature set. There have been several proposals for feature diagram languages with varying degrees of expressiveness, intuitiveness, and precision. However, these feature diagram languages have limited scalability when applied to realistic software systems. This article provides a systematic survey of various concerns of feature diagrams and ways in which concerns have been separated. The survey shows how the uncertainty in the purpose of feature diagram languages creates both conceptual and practical limitations to scalability of those languages.","title":"Separation of concerns in feature diagram languages: A systematic survey","doi":"doi>10.1145/2501654.2501665"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375593053","last_name":"hubaux","fist_name":"arnaud","full_name":"Arnaud Hubaux"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"than","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100205512","last_name":"tun","fist_name":"thein","full_name":"Thein Than Tun"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335491500","last_name":"heymans","fist_name":"patrick","full_name":"Patrick Heymans"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Reliability is quickly becoming a primary design constraint for high-end processors because of the inherent limits of manufacturability, extreme miniaturization of transistors, and the growing complexity of large multicore chips.

The public accessibility of such networks with the ability to share opinions, thoughts, information, and experience offers great promise to enterprises and governments. In addition to individuals using such networks to connect to their friends and families, governments and enterprises have started exploiting these platforms for delivering their services to citizens and customers. However, the success of such attempts relies on the level of trust that members have with each other as well as with the service provider. Therefore, trust becomes an essential and important element of a successful social network.

We first review the existing definitions of trust and definesocial trustin the context of social networks.

Applications such as network security, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Digital Rights Management (DRM), and pay per view have drawn attention to these three constraints. For more than ten years, many studies in the field of cryptographic engineering have focused on the design of optimized high-throughput hardware cryptographic cores (e.g., symmetric and asymmetric key block ciphers, stream ciphers, and hash functions). The flexibility of cryptographic systems plays a very important role in their practical application. Reconfigurable hardware systems can evolve with algorithms, face up to new types of attacks, and guarantee interoperability between countries and institutions. The flexibility of reconfigurable crypto processors and crypto coprocessors has reached new levels with the emergence of dynamically reconfigurable hardware architectures and tools. Last but not least, the security of systems that handle confidential information needs to be thoroughly evaluated at the design stage in order to meet security objectives that depend on the importance of the information to be protected and on the cost of protection. Usually, designers tackle security problems at the same time as other design constraints and in many cases target only one security objective, for example, a side-channel attack countermeasures, fault tolerance capability, or the monitoring of the device environment. Only a few authors have addressed all three design constraints at the same time. In particular, key management security (e.g., secure key generation and transmission, the use of a hierarchical key structure composed of session keys and master keys) has frequently been neglected to the benefit of performance and/or flexibility. Nevertheless, a few authors propose original processor architectures based on multi-crypto-processor structures and reconfigurable cryptographic arrays. In this article, we review published works on symmetric key crypto engines and present current trends and design challenges.","title":"Architectures of flexible symmetric key crypto engines—a survey: From hardware coprocessor to multi-crypto-processor system on chip","doi":"doi>10.1145/2501654.2501655"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100144063","last_name":"bossuet","fist_name":"lilian","full_name":"Lilian Bossuet"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81467662934","last_name":"grand","fist_name":"michael","full_name":"Michael Grand"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479664248","last_name":"gaspar","fist_name":"lubos","full_name":"Lubos Gaspar"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100312043","last_name":"fischer","fist_name":"viktor","full_name":"Viktor Fischer"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100392020","last_name":"gogniat","fist_name":"guy","full_name":"Guy Gogniat"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This article reviews the state-of-the-art inoverlappingcommunity detection algorithms, quality measures, and benchmarks.

After considering community-level detection performance measured by normalized mutual information, the Omega index, and node-level detection performance measured by F-score, we reached the following conclusions. For low overlapping density networks, SLPA, OSLOM, Game, and COPRA offer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with high overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both SLPA and Game provide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that the detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved.

Under this novel taxonomy, we conclude that all attempts to defeat botnets should be focused on one or more stages of this life-cycle. In fact, the sustained hindering of any of the stages makes it possible to thwart a botnet's progress and thus render it useless.

Transactions enable the handling of failure propagation over concurrent systems due to dependencies, restoring the system to the point before the failure occurred.

However, network coding systems are inherently vulnerable to a severe attack, known aspacket pollution, which presents a key obstacle to the deployment of such systems. Several cryptographic schemes have been proposed to defend against pollution attacks.We conduct a detailed analysis and an experimental evaluation in a realistic wireless network coding setting of a set of representative cryptographic defenses against pollution attacks. Our analysis identifies severe limitations of asymmetric-based schemes, which impose high communication overhead by placing constraints on the basic network coding parameters and high computation overhead by relying on numerous operations over large fields. Our analysis also shows that symmetric cryptographic schemes, while having better performance than asymmetric cryptographic-based schemes, impose prohibitive overhead in the presence of multiple byzantine adversaries. We further evaluate these schemes by using a set of typical network coding system parameters on a realistic topology. Our experimental evaluation shows that all the schemes we compare induce a throughput degradation that negates the performance benefits of network coding in the presence of multiple colluding adversaries.","title":"On the practicality of cryptographic defences against pollution attacks in wireless network coding","doi":"doi>10.1145/2480741.2480756"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350580937","last_name":"dong","fist_name":"jing","full_name":"Jing Dong"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This survey provides a structured and comprehensive overview of research on security and privacy in computer and communication networks that use game-theoretic approaches.

In our systematic classification a technique may belong to one primitive class or to a hybrid combination of such classes. In the latter case the technique is efficiently decomposed into more primitive components each one belonging to a specific class. The systematic classification assists in the in-depth understanding of the diverse classes of techniques which is essential for their further improvement.

In principle, virtualization involves the use of an encapsulating software layer (Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor) which surrounds or underlies an operating system and provides the same inputs, outputs, and behavior that would be expected from an actual physical device. This abstraction means that an ideal Virtual Machine Monitor provides an environment to the software equivalent to the host system, but which is decoupled from the hardware state. Because a virtual machine is not dependent on the state of the physical hardware, multiple virtual machines may be installed on a single set of hardware. The decoupling of physical and logical states gives virtualization inherent security benefits. However, the design, implementation, and deployment of virtualization technology have also opened up novel threats and security issues which, while not particular to system virtualization, take on new forms in relation to it. Reverse engineering becomes easier due to introspection capabilities, as encryption keys, security algorithms, low-level protection, intrusion detection, or antidebugging measures can become more easily compromised. Furthermore, associated technologies such as virtual routing and networking can create challenging issues for security, intrusion control, and associated forensic processes. We explain the security considerations and some associated methodologies by which security breaches can occur, and offer recommendations for how virtualized environments can best be protected. Finally, we offer a set of generalized recommendations that can be applied to achieve secure virtualized implementations.","title":"Virtualization: Issues, security threats, and solutions","doi":"doi>10.1145/2431211.2431216"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456626216","last_name":"pearce","fist_name":"michael","full_name":"Michael Pearce"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139634","last_name":"zeadally","fist_name":"sherali","full_name":"Sherali Zeadally"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100258695","last_name":"hunt","fist_name":"ray","full_name":"Ray Hunt"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This article addresses theonline exact string matching problemwhich consists in findingalloccurrences of a given patternpin a textt.

Further, the ear appears to degrade little with age.

Benefits of object orientation include support for modular design, code sharing, and extensibility. In order to make the most of these advantages, a type theory for objects and their interactions should be developed to aid checking and controlled derivation of programs and to support early binding of code bodies for efficiency. As a step in this direction, this paper surveys a number of existing type theories and examines the manner and extent to which these theories are able to represent the ideas found in object-oriented programming. Of primary interest are the models provided by type theories for abstract data types and inheritance, and the major portion of this paper is devoted to these topics. Code fragments illustrative of the various approaches are provided and discussed. The introduction provides an overview of object-oriented programming and types in programming languages; the summary provides a comparative evaluation of the reviewed typing systems, along with suggestions for future work.","title":"Type theories and object-oriented programmimg","doi":"doi>10.1145/62058.62060"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337977","last_name":"danforth","fist_name":"scott","full_name":"Scott Danforth"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100457410","last_name":"tomlinson","fist_name":"chris","full_name":"Chris Tomlinson"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"In computer design, it is essential to know the effectiveness of different design options in improving performance and dependability.

Rectangles are often used as an approximation of shapes for which they serve as the minimum rectilinear enclosing object. They arise in applications in cartography as well as very large-scale integration (VLSI) design rule checking. The different data structures are discussed in terms of how they support the execution of queries involving proximity relations. The focus is on intersection and subset queries. Several types of representations are described. Some are designed for use with the plane-sweep paradigm, which works well for static collections of rectangles. Others are oriented toward dynamic collections. In this case, one representation reduces each rectangle to a point in a higher multidimensional space and treats the problem as one involving point data. The other representation is area based—that is, it depends on the physical extent of each rectangle.","title":"Hierarchical representations of collections of small rectangles","doi":"doi>10.1145/50020.50021"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"A statistical profile summarizes the instances of a database.

Estimation of database profiles is critical in the problems of query optimization, physical database design, and database performance prediction. This paper describes a model of a database of profile, relates this model to estimating the cost of database operations, and surveys methods of estimating profiles. The operators and objects in the model include build profile, estimate profile, and update profile. The estimate operator is classified by the relational algebra operator (select, project, join), the property to be estimated (cardinality, distribution of values, and other parameters), and the underlying method (parametric, nonparametric, and ad-hoc). The accuracy, overhead, and assumptions of methods are discussed in detail.

It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system  builders can better support floating point.","title":"What every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic","doi":"doi>10.1145/103162.103163"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81410594782","last_name":"goldberg","fist_name":"david","full_name":"David Goldberg"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Three-dimensional medical imaging: algorithms and computer systems","doi":"doi>10.1145/125137.125155"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"r","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100642504","last_name":"stytz","fist_name":"m","full_name":"M R Stytz"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342494824","last_name":"frieder","fist_name":"g","full_name":"G Frieder"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100268938","last_name":"frieder","fist_name":"o","full_name":"O Frieder"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Evaluation of relational algebras incorporating the time dimension in databases","doi":"doi>10.1145/125137.125166"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"edwin","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100016555","last_name":"mckenzie","fist_name":"l","full_name":"L Edwin Mckenzie"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Voronoi diagrams—a survey of a fundamental geometric data structure","doi":"doi>10.1145/116873.116880"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100512983","last_name":"aurenhammer","fist_name":"franz","full_name":"Franz Aurenhammer"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Data structures and algorithms for disjoint set union problems","doi":"doi>10.1145/116873.116878"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Concurrency control in advanced database applications","doi":"doi>10.1145/116873.116875"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"s","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100139909","last_name":"barghouti","fist_name":"naser","full_name":"Naser S Barghouti"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"e","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100462066","last_name":"kaiser","fist_name":"gail","full_name":"Gail E Kaiser"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"At high data transmission rates, the packet transmission time of a local area network (LAN) could become comparable to or less than the medium propagation delay.

A wide repertoire of heuristic algorithms exists in the literature for efficiently arranging the logic cells on a VLSI chip.

Five major algorithms for placement are discussed: simulated annealing, force-directed placement, min-cut placement, placement by numerical optimization, and evolution-based placement. The first two classes of algorithms owe their origin to physical laws, the third and fourth are analytical techniques, and the fifth class of algorithms is derived from biological phenomena.

understanding protein functionalities. Recently, due to important results obtained with proteomics, a great interest has been given tointeractomics, that is, the study of protein-to-protein interactions, called PPI, or more generally, interactions among macromolecules, particularly within cells. Interactomics means studying, modeling, storing, and retrieving protein-to-protein interactions as well as algorithms for manipulating, simulating, and predicting interactions. PPI data can be obtained from biological experiments studying interactions. Modeling and storing PPIs can be realized by using graph theory and graph data management, thus graph databases can be queried for further experiments. PPI graphs can be used as input for data-mining algorithms, where raw data are binary interactions forming interaction graphs, and analysis algorithms retrieve biological interactions among proteins (i.e., PPI biological meanings). For instance, predicting the interactions between two or more proteins can be obtained by mining interaction networks stored in databases. In this article we survey modeling, storing, analyzing, and manipulating PPI data. After describing the main PPI models, mostly based on graphs, the article reviews PPI data representation and storage, as well as PPI databases. Algorithms and software tools for analyzing and managing PPI networks are discussed in depth. The article concludes by discussing the main challenges and research directions in PPI networks.","title":"Protein-to-protein interactions: Technologies, databases, and algorithms","doi":"doi>10.1145/1824795.1824796"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100557284","last_name":"cannataro","fist_name":"mario","full_name":"Mario Cannataro"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"h","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029618","last_name":"guzzi","fist_name":"pietro","full_name":"Pietro H Guzzi"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100343862","last_name":"veltri","fist_name":"pierangelo","full_name":"Pierangelo Veltri"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Owing to important applications such as mining web page traversal sequences, many algorithms have been introduced in the area of sequential pattern mining over the last decade, most of which have also been modified to support concise representations like closed, maximal, incremental or hierarchical sequences.

Software engineering research has typically focused on the development process, starting with user requirements—if that—with business modeling often confused with software system modeling [Isoda 2001]. Researchers and practitioners in management information systems have long recognized that understanding the business processes that an information system must support is key to eliciting the needs of its users (see e.g., Eriksson and Penker 2000]), but lacked the tools to model such business processes or to relate such models to software requirements. Researchers and practitioners in business administration have long been interested in modeling the processes of organizations for the purposes of understanding, analyzing, and improving such processes [Hammer and Champy 1993], but their models were often too coarse to be of use to software engineers. The advent of ecommerce and workflow management systems, among other things, has led to a convergence of interests and tools, within the broad IT community, for modeling and enabling business processes.

A popular type of such a mechanism is similarity querying. For a long time, the database-oriented applications of similarity search employed the definition of similarity restricted to metric distances. Due to its topological properties, metric similarity can be effectively used to index a database which can then be queried efficiently by so-called metric access methods. However, together with the increasing complexity of data entities across various domains, in recent years there appeared many similarities that werenotmetrics—we call themnonmetricsimilarity functions. In this article we survey domains employing nonmetric functions for effective similarity search, and methods for efficient nonmetric similarity search. First, we show that the ongoing research in many of these domains requires complex representations of data entities. Simultaneously, such complex representations allow us to model also complex and computationally expensive similarity functions (often represented by various matching algorithms). However, the more complex similarity function one develops, the more likely it will be a nonmetric. Second, we review state-of-the-art techniques for efficient (fast) nonmetric similarity search, concerning both exact and approximate search. Finally, we discuss some open problems and possible future research trends.","title":"On nonmetric similarity search problems in complex domains","doi":"doi>10.1145/1978802.1978813"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100306803","last_name":"skopal","fist_name":"tomas","full_name":"Tomas Skopal"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Craniofacial superimposition is a forensic process in which a photograph of a missing person is compared with a skull found to determine its identity.

While aspect-orientation originally has emerged at the programming level, it now stretches also over other development phases. There are, for example, already several proposals for Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM), most of them pursuing distinguished goals, providing different concepts as well as notations, and showing various levels of maturity. Consequently, there is an urgent need to provide an in-depth survey, clearly identifying commonalities and differences between current AOM approaches. Existing surveys in this area focus more on comprehensibility with respect to development phases or evaluated approaches rather than on comparability on bases of a detailed evaluation framework.This article tries to fill this gap focusing on aspect-oriented design modeling. As a prerequisite for an in-depth evaluation, a conceptual reference model is presented as the article's first contribution, centrally capturing the basic design concepts of AOM and their interrelationships in terms of a UML class diagram. Based on this conceptual reference model, an evaluation framework has been designed, resembling the second contribution, by deriving a detailed and well-defined catalogue of evaluation criteria, thereby operationalizing the conceptual reference model. This criteria catalogue is employed together with a running example in order to evaluate a carefully selected set of eight design-level AOM approaches representing the third contribution of the article. This per approach evaluation is complemented with an extensive report on lessons learned, summarizing the approaches' strengths and shortcomings.","title":"A survey on UML-based aspect-oriented design modeling","doi":"doi>10.1145/1978802.1978807"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317490231","last_name":"wimmer","fist_name":"manuel","full_name":"Manuel Wimmer"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81317489346","last_name":"schauerhuber","fist_name":"andrea","full_name":"Andrea Schauerhuber"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100275977","last_name":"kapsammer","fist_name":"elizabeth","full_name":"Elizabeth Kapsammer"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The architecture of a software-intensive system can be defined as the set of relevant design decisions that affect the qualities of the overall system functionality; therefore, architectural decisions are eventually crucial to the success of a software project.

The results show that there is no “best” decision-making technique; however, some techniques are more susceptible to specific difficulties. Hence architects should choose a decision-making technique based on the difficulties that they wish to avoid.

Furthermore, energy efficiency has become one of the most important challenges in designing disk drive storage systems. The architectural design of disk drives has reached a turning point which should allow their performance to advance further, while still maintaining high reliability and energy efficiency. This article explains how disk drives have evolved over five decades to meet challenging customer demands. First of all, it briefly introduces the development of disk drives, and deconstructs disk performance and power consumption. Secondly, it describes the design constraints and challenges that traditional disk drives are facing. Thirdly, it presents some innovative disk drive architectures discussed in the community. Fourthly, it introduces some new storage media types and the impacts they have on the architecture of the traditional disk drives. Finally, it discusses two important evolutions of disk drives: hybrid disk and solid state disk.

In current real-world WSN deployments, programming is typically carried out very close to the operating system, therefore requiring the programmer to focus on low-level system issues. This not only distracts the programmer from the application logic, but also requires a technical background rarely found among application domain experts. The need for appropriate high-level programming abstractions, capable of simplifying the programming chore without sacrificing efficiency, has long been recognized, and several solutions have hitherto been proposed, which differ along many dimensions.In this article, we survey the state of the art in programming approaches for WSNs. We begin by presenting a taxonomy of WSN applications, to identify the fundamental requirements programming platforms must deal with. Then, we introduce a taxonomy of WSN programming approaches that captures the fundamental differences among existing solutions, and constitutes the core contribution of this article. Our presentation style relies on concrete examples and code snippets taken from programming platforms representative of the taxonomy dimensions being discussed. We use the taxonomy to provide an exhaustive classification of existing approaches. Moreover, we also map existing approaches back to the application requirements, therefore providing not only a complete view of the state of the art, but also useful insights for selecting the programming abstraction most appropriate to the application at hand.","title":"Programming wireless sensor networks: Fundamental concepts and state of the art","doi":"doi>10.1145/1922649.1922656"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330495482","last_name":"mottola","fist_name":"luca","full_name":"Luca Mottola"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"pietro","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100279352","last_name":"picco","fist_name":"gian","full_name":"Gian Pietro Picco"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Human activity recognition is an important area of computer vision research. Its applications include surveillance systems, patient monitoring systems, and a variety of systems that involve interactions between persons and electronic devices such as human-computer interfaces. Most of these applications require an automated recognition of high-level activities, composed of multiple simple (or atomic) actions of persons. This article provides a detailed overview of various state-of-the-art research papers on human activity recognition. We discuss both the methodologies developed for simple human actions and those for high-level activities. An approach-based taxonomy is chosen that compares the advantages and limitations of each approach.Recognition methodologies for an analysis of the simple actions of a single person are first presented in the article. Space-time volume approaches and sequential approaches that represent and recognize activities directly from input images are discussed. Next, hierarchical recognition methodologies for high-level activities are presented and compared. Statistical approaches, syntactic approaches, and description-based approaches for hierarchical recognition are discussed in the article. In addition, we further discuss the papers on the recognition of human-object interactions and group activities. Public datasets designed for the evaluation of the recognition methodologies are illustrated in our article as well, comparing the methodologies' performances.

machines. It enables dynamic load distribution, fault resilience, eased system administration, and data access locality. Despite these goals and ongoing research efforts, migration has not achieved widespread use. With the increasing deployment of distributed systems in general, and distributed operating systems in particular, process migration is again receiving more attention in both research and product development. As high-performance facilities shift from supercomputers to networks of workstations, and with the ever-increasing role of the World Wide Web, we expect migration to play a more important role and eventually to be widely adopted.This survey reviews the field of process migration by summarizing the key concepts and giving an overview of the most important implementations. Design and implementation issues of process migration are analyzed in general, and then revisited for each of the case studies described: MOSIX, Sprite, Mach, and Load Sharing Facility. The benefits and drawbacks of process migration depend on the details of implementation and, therefore, this paper focuses on practical matters. This survey will help in understanding the potentials of process migration and why it has not caught on.","title":"Process migration","doi":"doi>10.1145/367701.367728"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"s","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314484115","last_name":"milojicic","fist_name":"dejan","full_name":"Dejan S Milojicic"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100470359","last_name":"douglis","fist_name":"fred","full_name":"Fred Douglis"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314485021","last_name":"paindaveine","fist_name":"yves","full_name":"Yves Paindaveine"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100253653","last_name":"wheeler","fist_name":"richard","full_name":"Richard Wheeler"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314487193","last_name":"zhou","fist_name":"songnian","full_name":"Songnian Zhou"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This survey describes research directions in techniques to improve the performance of programs written in the Java programming language. The standard technique for Java execution is interpretation, which provides for extensive portability of programs. A Java interpreter dynamically executes Java bytecodes, which comprise the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Execution time performance of Java programs can be improved through compilation, possibly at the expense of portability. Various types of Java compilers have been proposed, including Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers that compile bytecode into native processor instructions on the fly; direct compilers that directly translate the Java source code into the target processor's native language; and bytecode-to-source translators that generate either native code or an intermediate language, such as C, from the bytecodes. Additional techniques, including bytecode optimization, dynamic compilation, and executing Java programs in parallel, attempt to improve Java run-time performance while maintaining Java's portability. Another alternative for executing Java programs is a Java processor that implements the JVM directly in hardware. In this survey, we discuss the basis features, and the advantages and disadvantages, of the various Java execution techniques. We also discuss the various Java benchmarks that are being used by the Java community for performance evaluation of the different techniques. Finally, we conclude with a comparison of the performance of the alternative Java execution techniques based on reported results.","title":"Techniques for obtaining high performance in Java programs","doi":"doi>10.1145/367701.367714"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"h","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100538446","last_name":"kazi","fist_name":"iffat","full_name":"Iffat H Kazi"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"h","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350589232","last_name":"chen","fist_name":"howard","full_name":"Howard H Chen"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100650720","last_name":"stanley","fist_name":"berdenia","full_name":"Berdenia Stanley"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"In this paper we review studies of the growth of the Internet and \ntechnologies that are useful for information search and retrieval on the Web.

Although large cache hierarchies have proven to be effective in reducing this latency for the most frequently used data, it is still not uncommon for many programs to spend more than half their run times stalled on memory requests. Data prefetching has been proposed as a technique for hiding the access latency of data referencing patterns that defeat caching strategies. Rather than waiting for a cache miss to initiate a memory fetch, data prefetching anticipates such misses and issues a fetch to the memory system in advance of the actual memory reference. To be effective, prefetching must be  implemented in such a way that prefetches are timely, useful, and introduce little overhead. Secondary effects such as cache pollution and increased memory bandwidth requirements must also be taken into consideration. Despite these obstacles, prefetching has the potential to significantly improve overall program execution time by overlapping computation with memory accesses. Prefetching strategies are diverse, and no single strategy has yet been proposed that provides optimal performance. The following survey examines several alternative approaches, and discusses the design tradeoffs involved when implementing a data prefetch strategy.","title":"Data prefetch mechanisms","doi":"doi>10.1145/358923.358939"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"p","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100661869","last_name":"vanderwiel","fist_name":"steven","full_name":"Steven P Vanderwiel"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Laser scanning range sensors are widely used for high-precision, high-density three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and inspection of the surface of physical objects.

Efficiencies could be achieved by automating or semiautomating this process. While challenges remain, there are adequate solutions to semiautomate the scan-register-integrate tasks. On the other hand, view planning remains an open problem---that is, the task of finding a suitably small set of sensor poses and configurations for specified reconstruction or inspection goals.

Studies in the 1980s found no connection between IT investment and productivity in the U.S. economy, a situation referred to as theproductivity paradox. Since then, a decade of studies at the firm and country level has consistently shown that the impact of IT investment on labor productivity and economic growth is significant and positive. This article critically reviews the published research, more than 50 articles, on computers and productivity. It develops a general framework for classifying the research, which facilitates identifying what we know, how well we know it, and what we do not know. The framework enables us to systematically organize, synthesize, and evaluate the empirical evidence and to identify both limitations in existing research and data and substantive areas for future research.The review concludes that the productivity paradox as first formulated has been effectively refuted. At both the firm and the country level, greater investment in IT is associated with greater productivity growth. At the firm level, the review further concludes that the wide range of performance of IT investments among different organizations can be explained by complementary investments in organizational capital such as decentralized decision-making systems, job training, and business process redesign. IT is not simply a tool for automating existing processes, but is more importantly an enabler of organizational changes that can lead to additional productivity gains.In mid-2000, IT capital investment began to fall sharply due to slowing economic growth, the collapse of many Internet-related firms, and reductions in IT spending by other firms facing fewer competitive pressures from Internet firms. This reduction in IT investment has had devastating effects on the IT-producing sector, and may lead to slower economic and productivity growth in the U.S. economy. While the turmoil in the technology sector has been unsettling to investors and executives alike, this review shows that it should not overshadow the fundamental changes that have occurred as a result of firms' investments in IT. Notwithstanding the demise of many Internet-related companies, the returns to IT investment are real, and innovative companies continue to lead the way.","title":"Information technology and economic performance: A critical review of the empirical evidence","doi":"doi>10.1145/641865.641866"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81343491420","last_name":"dedrick","fist_name":"jason","full_name":"Jason Dedrick"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100370531","last_name":"gurbaxani","fist_name":"vijay","full_name":"Vijay Gurbaxani"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Hardware multithreading is becoming a generally applied technique in the next generation of microprocessors. Several multithreaded processors are announced by industry or already into production in the areas of high-performance microprocessors, media, and network processors.A multithreaded processor is able to pursue two or more threads of control in parallel within the processor pipeline. The contexts of two or more threads of control are often stored in separate on-chip register sets. Unused instruction slots, which arise from latencies during the pipelined execution of single-threaded programs by a contemporary microprocessor, are filled by instructions of other threads within a multithreaded processor. The execution units are multiplexed between the thread contexts that are loaded in the register sets.Underutilization of a superscalar processor due to missing instruction-level parallelism can be overcome by simultaneous multithreading, where a processor can issue multiple instructions from multiple threads each cycle. Simultaneous multithreaded processors combine the multithreading technique with a wide-issue superscalar processor to utilize a larger part of the issue bandwidth by issuing instructions from different threads simultaneously.Explicit multithreaded processors are multithreaded processors that apply processes or operating system threads in their hardware thread slots. These processors optimize the throughput of multiprogramming workloads rather than single-thread performance. We distinguish these processors from implicit multithreaded processors that utilize thread-level speculation by speculatively executing compiler- or machine-generated threads of control that are part of a single sequential program.This survey paper explains and classifies the explicit multithreading techniques in research and in commercial microprocessors.","title":"A survey of processors with explicit multithreading","doi":"doi>10.1145/641865.641867"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100531989","last_name":"ungerer","fist_name":"theo","full_name":"Theo Ungerer"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100304399","last_name":"robic","fist_name":"borut","full_name":"Borut Robic"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81339528576","last_name":"silc","fist_name":"jurij","full_name":"Jurij Silc"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years.

Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem.

In addition, maps—especially historical maps—are often the only information source about the earth as surveyed using geodetic techniques. In order to preserve these unique documents, increasing numbers of digital map archives have been established, driven by advances in software and hardware technologies. Since the early 1980s, researchers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and geography, have been working on computational methods for the extraction and recognition of geographic features from archived images of maps (digital map processing). The typical result from map processing is geographic information that can be used in spatial and spatiotemporal analyses in a Geographic Information System environment, which benefits numerous research fields in the spatial, social, environmental, and health sciences. However, map processing literature is spread across a broad range of disciplines in which maps are included as a special type of image. This article presents an overview of existing map processing techniques, with the goal of bringing together the past and current research efforts in this interdisciplinary field, to characterize the advances that have been made, and to identify future research directions and opportunities.","title":"A Survey of Digital Map Processing Techniques","doi":"doi>10.1145/2557423"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88158629757","last_name":"chiang","fist_name":"yao-yi","full_name":"Yao-Yi Chiang"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323492617","last_name":"leyk","fist_name":"stefan","full_name":"Stefan Leyk"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"a","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628789","last_name":"knoblock","fist_name":"craig","full_name":"Craig A Knoblock"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Languages that combine aspects of probabilistic representations with aspects of first-order logic are referred to as first-order probabilistic languages (FOPLs).

A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of features. Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible, due to the potentially exponential number of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of product-line analyses is both broad and diverse, so it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand their similarities and differences. We propose a classification of product-line analyses to enable systematic research and application.

Although the general approach to deduplication is shared by all storage types, each poses specific challenges and leads to different trade-offs and solutions. This diversity is often misunderstood, thus underestimating the relevance of new research and development.The first contribution of this article is a classification of deduplication systems according to six criteria that correspond to key design decisions: granularity, locality, timing, indexing, technique, and scope. This classification identifies and describes the different approaches used for each of them. As a second contribution, we describe which combinations of these design decisions have been proposed and found more useful for challenges in each storage type.

The U-I matrix provides the basis for collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, the dominant framework for recommender systems. Currently, new recommendation scenarios are emerging that offer promising new information that goes beyond the U-I matrix. This information can be divided into two categories related to its source: rich side information concerning users and items, and interaction information associated with the interplay of users and items. In this survey, we summarize and analyze recommendation scenarios involving information sources and the CF algorithms that have been recently developed to address them. We provide a comprehensive introduction to a large body of research, more than 200 key references, with the aim of supporting the further development of recommender systems exploiting information beyond the U-I matrix. On the basis of this material, we identify and discuss what we see as the central challenges lying ahead for recommender system technology, both in terms of extensions of existing techniques as well as of the integration of techniques and technologies drawn from other research areas.","title":"Collaborative Filtering beyond the User-Item Matrix: A Survey of the State of the Art and Future Challenges","doi":"doi>10.1145/2556270"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=88158982957","last_name":"shi","fist_name":"yue","full_name":"Yue Shi"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363601281","last_name":"larson","fist_name":"martha","full_name":"Martha Larson"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502652686","last_name":"hanjalic","fist_name":"alan","full_name":"Alan Hanjalic"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"In a wireless world, users can establish ad hoc virtual connections between devices that are unhampered by cables.

VSN devices come with image sensors, adequate processing power, and memory. They use wireless communication interfaces to collaborate and jointly solve tasks such as tracking persons within the network. VSNs are expected to replace not only many traditional, closed-circuit surveillance systems but also to enable emerging applications in scenarios such as elderly care, home monitoring, or entertainment. In all of these applications, VSNs monitor a potentially large group of people and record sensitive image data that might contain identities of persons, their behavior, interaction patterns, or personal preferences. These intimate details can be easily abused, for example, to derive personal profiles.The highly sensitive nature of images makes security and privacy in VSNs even more important than in most other sensor and data networks. However, the direct use of security techniques developed for related domains might be misleading due to the different requirements and design challenges. This is especially true for aspects such as data confidentiality and privacy protection against insiders, generating awareness among monitored people, and giving trustworthy feedback about recorded personal data—all of these aspects go beyond what is typically required in other applications.In this survey, we present an overview of the characteristics of VSN applications, the involved security threats and attack scenarios, and the major security challenges. A central contribution of this survey is our classification of VSN security aspects into data-centric, node-centric, network-centric, and user-centric security. We identify and discuss the individual security requirements and present a profound overview of related work for each class. We then discuss privacy protection techniques and identify recent trends in VSN security and privacy.

Depending on the specific CIDS architecture, central or distributed analysis components mine the gathered data to identify attacks. Resulting alerts are correlated among multiple monitors in order to create a holistic view of the network monitored. This article first determines relevant requirements for CIDSs; it then differentiates distinct building blocks as a basis for introducing a CIDS design space and for discussing it with respect to requirements.

Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult for system users (e.g., administrators and operators) to prevent, detect, and troubleshoot configuration errors due to the complexity of the configurations as well as the systems under configuration. As a result, the cost of resolving configuration errors is often tremendous from the aspects of both compensating the service disruptions and diagnosing, recovering from the failures. The prevalence, severity, and cost have made configuration errors one of the most thorny system problems that desire to be addressed.This survey article provides a holistic and structured overview of the systems approaches that tackle configuration errors. To understand the problem fundamentally, we first discuss the characteristics of configuration errors and the challenges of tackling such errors. Then, we discuss the state-of-the-art systems approaches that address different types of configuration errors in different scenarios. Our primary goal is to equip the stakeholder with a better understanding of configuration errors and the potential solutions for resolving configuration errors in the spectrum of system development and management. To inspire follow-up research, we further discuss the open problems with regard to system configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on the topic of tackling configuration errors.","title":"Systems Approaches to Tackling Configuration Errors: A Survey","doi":"doi>10.1145/2791577"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453626809","last_name":"xu","fist_name":"tianyin","full_name":"Tianyin Xu"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81451594551","last_name":"zhou","fist_name":"yuanyuan","full_name":"Yuanyuan Zhou"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The public Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud industry has reached a critical mass in the past few years, with many cloud service providers fielding competing services.

Currently, many individuals and organizations mitigate the burden of local data storage and reduce the maintenance cost by outsourcing data to the cloud. However, the outsourced data is not always trustworthy due to the loss of physical control and possession over the data. As a result, many scholars have concentrated on relieving the security threats of the outsourced data by designing the Remote Data Auditing (RDA) technique as a new concept to enable public auditability for the stored data in the cloud. The RDA is a useful technique to check the reliability and integrity of data outsourced to a single or distributed servers. This is because all of the RDA techniques for single cloud servers are unable to support data recovery; such techniques are complemented with redundant storage mechanisms. The article also reviews techniques of remote data auditing more comprehensively in the domain of the distributed clouds in conjunction with the presentation of classifying ongoing developments within this specified area. The thematic taxonomy of the distributed storage auditing is presented based on significant parameters, such as scheme nature, security pattern, objective functions, auditing mode, update mode, cryptography model, and dynamic data structure. The more recent remote auditing approaches, which have not gained considerable attention in distributed cloud environments, are also critically analyzed and further categorized into three different classes, namely, replication based, erasure coding based, and network coding based, to present a taxonomy. This survey also aims to investigate similarities and differences of such a framework on the basis of the thematic taxonomy to diagnose significant and explore major outstanding issues.","title":"Remote Data Auditing in Cloud Computing Environments: A Survey, Taxonomy, and Open Issues","doi":"doi>10.1145/2764465"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=87959162157","last_name":"sookhak","fist_name":"mehdi","full_name":"Mehdi Sookhak"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375614585","last_name":"gani","fist_name":"abdullah","full_name":"Abdullah Gani"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658718735","last_name":"talebian","fist_name":"hamid","full_name":"Hamid Talebian"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658715598","last_name":"akhunzada","fist_name":"adnan","full_name":"Adnan Akhunzada"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"u","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452604676","last_name":"khan","fist_name":"samee","full_name":"Samee U Khan"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"A disruptive technology fundamentally transforming the way that computing services are delivered, cloud computing offers information and communication technology users a new dimension of convenience of resources, as services via the Internet.

As a result, first responders, decision makers, and the public can use this information to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds. In particular, many social media messages communicated during emergencies convey timely, actionable information. Processing social media messages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information found in messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages and highlight both their contributions and shortcomings. In addition, we examine their particularities, and methodically examine a series of key subproblems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries. Research thus far has, to a large extent, produced methods to extract situational awareness information from social media. In this survey, we cover these various approaches, and highlight their benefits and shortcomings.

This article surveys existing and proposed future content delivery architectures detailing their methodologies for providing efficient low-cost content distribution, content accounting, and accountability across trustworthy and untrustworthy infrastructures. We use two methods to help identify the drawbacks and merits of these architectures.

Specifically, we first study how to measure human mobility: what types of sensors we can use and what types of mobility information we can acquire. Next, we discuss how mobility assists localization with respect to enhancing location accuracy, decreasing deployment cost, and enriching location context. Moreover, considering the quality and cost of smartphone built-in sensors, handling measurement errors is essential and accordingly investigated. Combining existing work and our own working experiences, we emphasize the principles and conduct comparative study of the mainstream technologies.

Various techniques for covert channels have arisen in the past few decades. We surveyed and analyzed 109 techniques developed between 1987 and 2013 and show that these techniques can be reduced to only 11 different patterns. Moreover, the majority (69.7&percnt;) of techniques can be categorized into only four different patterns (i.e., most techniques we surveyed are similar). We represent the patterns in a hierarchical catalog using a pattern language. Our pattern catalog will serve as a base for future covert channel novelty evaluation. Furthermore, we apply the concept of pattern variations to network covert channels. With pattern variations, the context of a pattern can change. For example, a channel developed for IPv4 can automatically be adapted to other network protocols. We also propose the pattern-based covert channel optimizations pattern hopping and pattern combination. Finally, we lay the foundation for pattern-based countermeasures: whereas many current countermeasures were developed for specific channels, a pattern-oriented approach allows application of one countermeasure to multiple channels. Hence, future countermeasure development can focus on patterns, and the development of real-world protection against covert channels is greatly simplified.","title":"Pattern-Based Survey and Categorization of Network Covert Channel Techniques","doi":"doi>10.1145/2684195"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493654878","last_name":"wendzel","fist_name":"steffen","full_name":"Steffen Wendzel"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100615569","last_name":"zander","fist_name":"sebastian","full_name":"Sebastian Zander"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81444593438","last_name":"fechner","fist_name":"bernhard","full_name":"Bernhard Fechner"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487653567","last_name":"herdin","fist_name":"christian","full_name":"Christian Herdin"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADBuy this ArticlePDF (2.06 MB)APPENDICES and SUPPLEMENTSa46-ardito-apndx.pdf \r\n                 \r\n                Supplemental movie, appendix, image and software files for, Interaction with Large Displays: A Survey","title":"Interaction with Large Displays: A Survey","doi":"doi>10.1145/2682623"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314481061","last_name":"ardito","fist_name":"carmelo","full_name":"Carmelo Ardito"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100302537","last_name":"buono","fist_name":"paolo","full_name":"Paolo Buono"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"francesca","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100096224","last_name":"costabile","fist_name":"maria","full_name":"Maria Francesca Costabile"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502806771","last_name":"desolda","fist_name":"giuseppe","full_name":"Giuseppe Desolda"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"In response to the revival of virtualized technology by Rosenblum and Garfinkel [2005], NIST defined cloud computing, a new paradigm in service computing infrastructures. In cloud environments, the basic security mechanism is ingrained in virtualization—that is, the execution of instructions at different privilege levels. Despite its obvious benefits, the caveat is that a crashed virtual machine (VM) is much harder to recover than a crashed workstation. When crashed, a VM is nothing but a giant corrupt binary file and quite unrecoverable by standard disk-based forensics. Therefore, VM crashes should be avoided at all costs. Security is one of the major contributors to such VM crashes. This includes compromising the hypervisor, cloud storage, images of VMs used infrequently, and remote cloud client used by the customer as well as threat from malicious insiders. Although using secure infrastructures such as private clouds alleviate several of these security problems, most cloud users end up using cheaper options such as third-party infrastructures (i.e., private clouds), thus a thorough discussion of all known security issues is pertinent. Hence, in this article, we discuss ongoing research in cloud security in order of the attack scenarios exploited most often in the cloud environment. We explore attack scenarios that call for securing the hypervisor, exploiting co-residency of VMs, VM image management, mitigating insider threats, securing storage in clouds, abusing lightweight software-as-a-service clients, and protecting data propagation in clouds. Wearing a practitioner's glasses, we explore the relevance of each attack scenario to a service company like Infosys. At the same time, we draw parallels between cloud security research and implementation of security solutions in the form of enterprise security suites for the cloud. We discuss the state of practice in the form of enterprise security suites that include cryptographic solutions, access control policies in the cloud, new techniques for attack detection, and security quality assurance in clouds.","title":"Secure the Cloud: From the Perspective of a Service-Oriented Organization","doi":"doi>10.1145/2693841"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658664564","last_name":"roy","fist_name":"arpan","full_name":"Arpan Roy"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81557350356","last_name":"sarkar","fist_name":"santonu","full_name":"Santonu Sarkar"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81508687374","last_name":"ganesan","fist_name":"rajeshwari","full_name":"Rajeshwari Ganesan"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81558593556","last_name":"goel","fist_name":"geetika","full_name":"Geetika Goel"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Technology downscaling is expected to amplify a variety of reliability concerns in future digital systems.

The review indicated that the state of the art mainly consists of person-dependent models (62.2&percnt; of systems) that fuse audio and visual (55.6&percnt;) information to detect acted (52.2&percnt;) expressions of basic emotions and simple dimensions of arousal and valence (64.5&percnt;) with feature- (38.9&percnt;) and decision-level (35.6&percnt;) fusion techniques. However, there were also person-independent systems that considered additional modalities to detect nonbasic emotions and complex dimensions using model-level fusion techniques. The meta-analysis revealed that MM systems were consistently (85&percnt; of systems) more accurate than their best unimodal counterparts, with an average improvement of 9.83&percnt; (median of 6.60&percnt;). However, improvements were three times lower when systems were trained on natural (4.59&percnt;) versus acted data (12.7&percnt;).

We presented a qualitative analysis of the findings, including stakeholders, challenges, standards, techniques, and validations employed in these primary studies. Our main results include the following: (1) Service integrator is the key stakeholder that largely impacts how regression testing is performed. (2) Challenges of cost and autonomy issues have been studied heavily. However, more emphasis should be put on the other challenges, such as test timing, dynamics, privacy, quota constraints, and concurrency issues. (3) Orchestration-based services have been largely studied, while little attention has been paid to either choreography-based services or semantic-based services. (4) An appreciable amount of web service regression testing techniques have been proposed, including 48 test case prioritization techniques, 10 test selection techniques, two test suite minimization techniques, and another collaborative technique.

OR has gained a lot of attention from the research communities for its ability to increase the performance of wireless networks. It benefits from the broadcast characteristic of wireless mediums to improve network performance. The basic function of OR is its ability to overhear the transmitted packet and to coordinate among relaying nodes. In OR, a candidate set is a potential group of nodes that is selected as the next-hop forwarders. Hence, each node in OR can use different potential paths to send packets toward the destination. Any of the candidates of a node that have received the transmitted packet may forward it. The decision of choosing the next forwarder is made by coordination between candidates that have successfully received the transmitted packet. In OR, by using a dynamic relay node to forward the packet, the transmission reliability and network throughput can be increased.

These playlists are basically sequences of tracks that traditionally are designed manually and whose organization is based on some underlying logic or theme. With the digitalization of music and the availability of various types of additional track-related information on the Web, new opportunities have emerged on how to automate the playlist creation process. Correspondingly, a number of proposals for automated playlist generation have been made in the literature during the past decade. These approaches vary both with respect to which kind of data they rely on and which types of algorithms they use. In this article, we review the literature on automated playlist generation and categorize the existing approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation designs that are used today in research to assess the quality of the generated playlists. Finally, we report the results of a comparative evaluation of typical playlist generation schemes based on historical data.

Due to the known complexities and dynamism of online communities, designing a successful community is deemed more an art than a science. Numerous studies have investigated different aspects of certain types of OPCs. Most of these studies, however, fall short of delivering a general view or prescription due to their narrow focus on a certain type of OPCs. In contribution to theories on technology-mediated social participation (TMSP), this study synthesizes the streams of research in the particular area of OPCs and delivers a theoretical framework as a baseline for adapting findings from one specific type of community on another. This framework consists of four primary dimensions, namely, platform features, content, user, and community. The corresponding attributes of these dimensions and the existing interdependencies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, a decision diagram for selecting features and a design guideline for “decontextualizing” findings are introduced as possible applications of the framework.

We also present experimental results, comparing the effectiveness of some of the surveyed methods.","title":"Feature-based similarity search in 3D object databases","doi":"doi>10.1145/1118890.1118893"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100561112","last_name":"saupe","fist_name":"dietmar","full_name":"Dietmar Saupe"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100025589","last_name":"schreck","fist_name":"tobias","full_name":"Tobias Schreck"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"v","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100647172","last_name":"vranic","fist_name":"dejan","full_name":"Dejan V Vranic"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Packet classification is an enabling function for a variety of Internet applications including quality of service, security, monitoring, and multimedia communications. In order to classify a packet as belonging to a particular flow or set of flows, network nodes must perform a search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. In general, there have been two major threads of research addressing packet classification, algorithmic and architectural. A few pioneering groups of researchers posed the problem, provided complexity bounds, and offered a collection of algorithmic solutions. Subsequently, the design space has been vigorously explored by many offering new algorithms and improvements on existing algorithms. Given the inability of early algorithms to meet performance constraints imposed by high speed links, researchers in industry and academia devised architectural solutions to the problem. This thread of research produced the most widely-used packet classification device technology, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). New architectural research combines intelligent algorithms and novel architectures to eliminate many of the unfavorable characteristics of current TCAMs. We observe that the community appears to be converging on a combined algorithmic and architectural approach to the problem. Using a taxonomy based on the high-level approach to the problem and a minimal set of running examples, we provide a survey of the seminal and recent solutions to the problem. It is our hope to foster a deeper understanding of the various packet classification techniques while providing a useful framework for discerning relationships and distinctions.","title":"Survey and taxonomy of packet classification techniques","doi":"doi>10.1145/1108956.1108958"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"e","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452609746","last_name":"taylor","fist_name":"david","full_name":"David E Taylor"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Power consumption is a major factor that limits the performance of computers.

Because flash memories are nonvolatile and relatively dense, they are now used to store files and other persistent objects in handheld computers, mobile phones, digital cameras, portable music players, and many other computer systems in which magnetic disks are inappropriate. Flash, like earlier EEPROM devices, suffers from two limitations. First, bits can only be cleared by erasing a large block of memory. Second, each block can only sustain a limited number of erasures, after which it can no longer reliably store data. Due to these limitations, sophisticated data structures and algorithms are required to effectively use flash memories. These algorithms and data structures support efficient not-in-place updates of data, reduce the number of erasures, and level the wear of the blocks in the device. This survey presents these algorithms and data structures, many of which have only been described in patents until now.","title":"Algorithms and data structures for flash memories","doi":"doi>10.1145/1089733.1089735"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100567868","last_name":"gal","fist_name":"eran","full_name":"Eran Gal"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Topology Control (TC) is one of the most important techniques used in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks to reduce energy consumption (which is essential to extend the network operational time) and radio interference (with a positive effect on the network traffic carrying capacity).

A general model for a dataflow machine is presented and the major design options are discussed.Most dataflow machines described in the literature are surveyed on the basis of this model and its associated technology. For general-purpose computing the most promising dataflow machines are those that employ packet-switching communication and support general recursion. Such a recursion mechanism requires an extremely fast mechanism to map a sparsely occupied virtual space to a physical space of realistic size. No solution has yet proved fully satisfactory.A working prototype of one processing element is described in detail. On the basis of experience with this prototype, some of the objections raised against the dataflow approach are discussed. It appears that the overhead due to fine-grain parallelism can be made acceptable by sophisticated compiling and employing special hardware for the storage of data structures. Many computing-intensive programs show sufficient parallelism. In fact, a major problem is to restrain parallelism when machine resources tend to get overloaded. Another issue that requires further investigation is the distribution of computation and data structures over the processing elements.","title":"Dataflow machine architecture","doi":"doi>10.1145/27633.28055"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"h","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100591221","last_name":"veen","fist_name":"arthur","full_name":"Arthur H Veen"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"One of the fundamental principles of the database approach is that a database allows a nonredundant, unified representation of all data managed in an organization.

A set of basic transformations has been developed for the three types of relations: entity relations, extended entity relations, and relationship relations. Candidate relations are further analyzed and modified to attain the highest degree of normalization desired.The methodology produces database designs that are not only accurate representations of reality, but flexible enough to accommodate future processing requirements. It also reduces the number of data dependencies that must be analyzed, using the extended ER model conceptualization, and maintains data integrity through normalization.

differential equations (ODEs). To study the system behavior predicted by a model, these equations are usually solved numerically.Although many of the current methods for solving ODEs were developed around the turn of the century, the past 15 years or so has been a period of intensive research. The emphasis of this survey is on the methods and techniques used in software for solving ODEs.ODEs can be classified as stiff or nonstiff, and may be stiff for some parts of an interval and nonstiff for others.

We develop a &lgr;-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages.The evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed &lgr;-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction.The typed &lgr;-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for the augmented &lgr;-calculus are discussed.The augmented typed &lgr;-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun instead of &lgr; is the functional abstraction keyword and because it is pleasant to deal with.Fun is mathematically simple and can serve as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive than those of existing programming languages.

Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems.   These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space,   and  search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.","title":"A survey of image registration techniques","doi":"doi>10.1145/146370.146374"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"gottesfeld","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81543112356","last_name":"brown","fist_name":"lisa","full_name":"Lisa Gottesfeld Brown"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Research aimed at correcting words in text has focused on three progressively more difficult problems:(1) nonword error detection; (2) isolated-word error correction; and (3) context-dependent work correction.

This simple yet powerful vision was introduced in 1968. Software reuse has, however, failed to become a standard software engineering practice. In an attempt to understand why, researchers have renewed their interest in software reuse and in the obstacles to implementing it.This paper surveys the different approaches to software reuse found in the research literature. It uses a taxonomy to describe and compare the different approaches and make generalizations about the field of software reuse. The taxonomy characterizes each reuse approach in terms of its reusableartifactsand the way these artifacts areabstracted, selected, specialized,andintegrated.Abstraction plays a central role in software reuse. Concise and expressive abstractions are essential if software artifacts are to be effectively reused. The effectiveness of a reuse technique can be evaluated in terms ofcognitive distance—an intuitive gauge of the intellectual effort required to use the technique. Cognitive distance is reduced in two ways: (1) Higher level abstractions in a reuse technique reduce the effort required to go from the initial concept of a software system to representations in the reuse technique, and (2) automation reduces the effort required to go from abstractions in a reuse technique to an executable implementation.This  survey  will help answer the following questions: What is software reuse?

We show the implications of each dimension on the design of the underlying techniques. We also discuss top-kqueries in XML domain, and show their connections to relational approaches.","title":"A survey of top-kquery processing techniques in relational database systems","doi":"doi>10.1145/1391729.1391730"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"f","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100281047","last_name":"ilyas","fist_name":"ihab","full_name":"Ihab F Ilyas"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381599567","last_name":"beskales","fist_name":"george","full_name":"George Beskales"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"a","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100293877","last_name":"soliman","fist_name":"mohamed","full_name":"Mohamed A Soliman"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Differential topology, and specifically Morse theory, provide a suitable setting for formalizing and solving several problems related to shape analysis. The fundamental idea behind Morse theory is that of combining the topological exploration of a shape with quantitative measurement of geometrical properties provided by a real function defined on the shape. The added value of approaches based on Morse theory is in the possibility of adopting different functions as shape descriptors according to the properties and invariants that one wishes to analyze. In this sense, Morse theory allows one to construct ageneral frameworkfor shape characterization, parametrized with respect to the mapping function used, and possibly the space associated with the shape. The mapping function plays the role of alensthrough which we look at the properties of the shape, and different functions provide different insights.In the last decade, an increasing number of methods that are rooted in Morse theory and make use of properties of real-valued functions for describing shapes have been proposed in the literature. The methods proposed range from approaches which use the configuration of contours for encoding topographic surfaces to more recent work on size theory and persistent homology. All these have been developed over the years with a specific target domain and it is not trivial to systematize this work and understand the links, similarities, and differences among the different methods. Moreover, different terms have been used to denote the same mathematical constructs, which often overwhelm the understanding of the underlying common framework.The aim of this survey is to provide a clear vision of what has been developed so far, focusing on methods that make use of theoretical frameworks that are developed forclassesof real functions rather than for a single function, even if they are applied in a restricted manner. The termgeometrical-topologicalused in the title is meant to underline that both levels of information content are relevant for the applications of shape descriptions: geometrical, or metrical, properties and attributes are crucial for characterizing specific instances of features, while topological properties are necessary to abstract and classify shapes according to invariant aspects of their geometry. The approaches surveyed will be discussed in detail, with respect to theory, computation, and application. Several properties of the shape descriptors will be analyzed and compared. We believe this is a crucial step to exploit fully the potential of such approaches in many applications, as well as to identify important areas of future research.","title":"Describing shapes by geometrical-topological properties of real functions","doi":"doi>10.1145/1391729.1391731"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100196607","last_name":"biasotti","fist_name":"s","full_name":"S Biasotti"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"de","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100169019","last_name":"floriani","fist_name":"l","full_name":"L De Floriani"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100540810","last_name":"falcidieno","fist_name":"b","full_name":"B Falcidieno"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100341088","last_name":"frosini","fist_name":"p","full_name":"P Frosini"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81335491092","last_name":"giorgi","fist_name":"d","full_name":"D Giorgi"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81375615003","last_name":"landi","fist_name":"c","full_name":"C Landi"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327490862","last_name":"papaleo","fist_name":"l","full_name":"L Papaleo"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81336493063","last_name":"spagnuolo","fist_name":"m","full_name":"M Spagnuolo"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Trust management systems are frameworks for authorization in modern distributed systems, allowing remotely accessible resources to be protected by providers.

To this end, we first provide an introduction to the motivation and concepts of autonomic computing and describe some research that has been seen as seminal in influencing a large proportion of early work. Taking the components of an established reference model in turn, we discuss the works that have provided significant contributions to that area. We then look at larger scaled systems that compose autonomic systems illustrating the hierarchical nature of their architectures. Autonomicity is not a well defined subject and as such different systems adhere to different degrees of Autonomicity, therefore we cross-slice the body of work in terms of these degrees.

It reviews the philosophical motivations of semantic models, including the need for high-level modeling abstractions and the reduction of semantic overloading of data type constructors.

The former is the number of cells in error divided by the total number of cells; the latter is the number of correct cells divided by the total number of cells. However, databases may have similar error rates (or accuracy percentages) but differ drastically in the complexity of their accuracy problems. A simple percent does not provide information as to whether the errors are systematic or randomly distributed throughout the database. We expand the accuracy metric to include a randomness measure and include a probability distribution value. The proposed randomness check is based on the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity measure. Through two simulation studies we show that the LZ complexity measure can clearly differentiate as to whether the errors are random or systematic. This determination is a significant first step and is a major departure from the percentage-alone technique. Once it is determined that the errors are random, a probability distribution, Poisson, is used to help address various managerial questions.","title":"An Accuracy Metric: Percentages, Randomness, and Probabilities","doi":"doi>10.1145/1659225.1659229"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"w","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100550044","last_name":"fisher","fist_name":"craig","full_name":"Craig W Fisher"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"c","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453606183","last_name":"matheus","fist_name":"carolyn","full_name":"Carolyn C Matheus"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Quantitative assessment of data quality is critical for identifying the presence of data defects and the extent of the damage due to these defects.

Impartial assessment measures the extent to which a dataset is defective, independent of the context in which that dataset is used. Contextual assessment, as defined in this study, measures the extent to which the presence of defects reduces a dataset’s utility, the benefits gained by using that dataset in a specific context. The dual assessment methodology is demonstrated in the context of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), using large data samples from real-world datasets. The results from comparing the two assessments offer important insights for directing quality maintenance efforts and prioritizing quality improvement solutions for this dataset.

To overcome the signature alteration caused by the embedding perturbation and other possible encoding operations, a closed-form compensation technique is proposed for ensuring signature consistency by employing a Lagrangian-based approach. A minimum distortion criterion is used to ensure signal quality. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is investigated with simulations of examples of image authentication in which signatures are designed to reveal tamper localization.

Database query languages such as SQL and XQuery offer a concise and high-level means by which such analyses can be implemented, facilitating the extraction of relevant data subsets into either generic or bespoke data analysis environments. Unfortunately, the quality of data in these repositories is often highly variable. The data is still useful, but only if the consumer is aware of the data quality problems and can work around them. Standard query languages offer little support for this aspect of data management. In principle, however, it should be possible to embed constraints describing the consumer’s data quality requirements into the query directly, so that the query evaluator can take over responsibility for enforcing them during query processing.Most previous attempts to incorporate information quality constraints into database queries have been based around a small number of highly generic quality measures, which are defined and computed by the information provider. This is a useful approach in some application areas but, in practice, quality criteria are more commonly determined by the user of the information not by the provider. In this article, we explore an approach to incorporating quality constraints into database queries where the definition of quality is set by the user and not the provider of the information. Our approach is based around the concept of aquality view, a configurable quality assessment component into which domain-specific notions of quality can be embedded. We examine how quality views can be incorporated into XQuery, and draw from this the language features that are required in general to embed quality views into any query language. We also propose some syntactic sugar on top of XQuery to simplify the process of querying with quality constraints.","title":"Incorporating Domain-Specific Information Quality Constraints into Database Queries","doi":"doi>10.1145/1577840.1577846"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"m","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628057","last_name":"embury","fist_name":"suzanne","full_name":"Suzanne M Embury"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100381213","last_name":"missier","fist_name":"paolo","full_name":"Paolo Missier"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100610421","last_name":"sampaio","fist_name":"sandra","full_name":"Sandra Sampaio"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"mark","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100338898","last_name":"greenwood","fist_name":"r","full_name":"R Mark Greenwood"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"d","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100078737","last_name":"preece","fist_name":"alun","full_name":"Alun D Preece"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Editorial Letter for the Special Issue on Data Quality in Databases and Information Systems","doi":"doi>10.1145/1577840.1577841"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Record-linkage is the process of identifying whether two separate records refer to the same real-world entity when some elements of the record’s identifying information (attributes) agree and others disagree.

The poor data quality of these databases, e.g. inaccuracy of drug contraindications, can lead to catastrophic consequences for the health condition of patients. Hence it is important to ensure their quality in terms of data completeness and soundness.In the database domain, standard Functional Dependencies (FDs) and INclusion Dependencies (INDs), have been proposed to prevent the insertion of incorrect data. But they are generally not expressive enough to represent a domain-specific set of constraints. To this end, conditional dependencies, i.e. standard dependencies extended with tableau patterns containing constant values, have been introduced and several methods have been proposed for their discovery and representation. The quality of drug databases can be considerably improved by their usage.Moreover, pharmacology information is inherently hierarchical and many standards propose graph structures to represent them, e.g. the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC) or OpenGalen’s terminology. In this article, we emphasize that the technologies of the Semantic Web are adapted to represent these hierarchical structures, i.e. in RDFS and OWL. We also present a solution for representing conditional dependencies using a query language defined for these graph oriented structures, namely SPARQL. The benefits of this approach are interoperability with applications and ontologies of the Semantic Web as well as a reasoning-based query execution solution to clean underlying databases.","title":"Improving the Data Quality of Drug Databases using Conditional Dependencies and Ontologies","doi":"doi>10.1145/2378016.2378019"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351606083","last_name":"cure","fist_name":"olivier","full_name":"Olivier Cure"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Pervasive environments generate large quantities of data, originating from backend servers, portable devices, and wireless mobile sensors. Pervasive sensing devices that monitor properties of the environment (including human beings) can be a large data source. Unprocessed datasets may include data that is faulty and irrelevant, and data that is important and useful. If not managed correctly the large amount of data from a data-rich pervasive environment may result in information overload or delivery of incorrect information.Context-sensitive quality data management aims to gather, verify, process, and manage the multiple data sources in a pervasive environment in order to deliver high quality, relevant information to the end-user. Managing the quality of data from different sources, correlating related data, and making use of context, are all essential in providing end users with accurate and meaningful data in real time. This requirement is especially true for critical applications such as in a medical environment.This article presents the Data Management System (DMS) architecture. It is designed to deliver quality data service to its users. The DMS architecture employs an agent-based middleware to intelligently and effectively manage all pervasive data sources, and to make use of context to deliver relevant information to the end-user. Two of the DMS components are presented: (1) data validation and (2) data consistency. The DMS components have been rigorously evaluated using various medical-based test cases.This article demonstrates a careful, precise approach to data based on the quality of the data and the context of its use.

Indeed, general practice has been shown in other countries to be an important and rich source of information about the health of the population, their behaviors and their utilization of health services. Funded by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) undertook a feasibility study of diagnostic coding of routinely entered patient data and the creation of a national general practice morbidity and epidemiological database (GPMED project). This article outlines the process of data quality issue management undertaken.The study’s findings suggest that the quality of data collection and reporting structures available in general practice throughout Ireland at the outset of this project were not adequate to permit the creation of a database of sufficient quality for service planning and policy or epidemiological research. Challenges include the dearth of a minimum standard of data recorded in consultations by GPs and the absence of the digital data recording and exporting infrastructure within Irish patient management software systems. In addition, there is at present a lack of recognition regarding the value of such data for patient management and service planning---including importantly, data collectors who do not fully accept the merit of maintaining data, which has a direct consequence for data quality.

This article studies a new problem in connection with data cleaning, namely the interaction between record matching and data repairing. We show that repairing can effectively help us identify matches, and vice versa. To capture the interaction, we provide a uniform framework that seamlessly unifies repairing and matching operations to clean a database based on integrity constraints, matching rules, and master data. We give a full treatment of fundamental problems associated with data cleaning via matching and repairing, including the static analyses of constraints and rules taken together, and the complexity, termination, and determinism analyses of data cleaning. We show that these problems are hard, ranging from NP-complete or coNP-complete, to PSPACE-complete. Nevertheless, we propose efficient algorithms to clean data via both matching and repairing. The algorithms finddeterministicfixesandreliablefixesbased on confidence and entropy analyses, respectively, which are more accurate than fixes generated by heuristics. Heuristic fixes are produced only when deterministic or reliable fixes are unavailable.

In the case study, we hypothesize that one can develop a file retention policy by testing causal relations between file attributes (as used by file retention methods) and the use value of files.

This would imply the ineffectiveness of the used attributes in our study or errors in our conceptualization of file value.

Because of this there is a growing interest in competitive intelligence and intelligence information gathering systems (IIS). This article uses game-theoretic concepts to develop an analytic framework to assess the value of deploying a competitive intelligence gathering information system. Modeling the competitive environment as a game provides a useful approach to study and evaluate competitive strategies given diverse assumptions about the quality of the information known by the players. When determining the value of deploying an IIS, decision makers need to examine three components of the competitive environment: the competitive rules of the game, the state of player knowledge, and the reliability of the information gathered. This framework focuses on competitive environments where the players' state of knowledge (i.e., common versus covert knowledge) and the reliability of the information generated are essential to the decision making process. The article concludes with implications for research and practice.","title":"Competitive intelligence and information quality: A game-theoretic perspective","doi":"doi>10.1145/2458517.2458520"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758796657","last_name":"biran","fist_name":"dov","full_name":"Dov Biran"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"h","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81408593002","last_name":"zack","fist_name":"michael","full_name":"Michael H Zack"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"j","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81758718057","last_name":"briotta","fist_name":"richard","full_name":"Richard J Briotta"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADBuy this ArticlePDF (1.69 MB)APPENDICES and SUPPLEMENTSa9-panse_appendix.pdf \r\n                 \r\n                The proof is given in an electronic appendix, available online in the ACM Digital Library.","title":"Indeterministic Handling of Uncertain Decisions in Deduplication","doi":"doi>10.1145/2435221.2435225"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453651308","last_name":"panse","fist_name":"fabian","full_name":"Fabian Panse"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"van","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100627247","last_name":"keulen","fist_name":"maurice","full_name":"Maurice Van Keulen"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100155820","last_name":"ritter","fist_name":"norbert","full_name":"Norbert Ritter"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Entity Resolution(ER) is a data quality challenge that deals with ambiguous references in data and whose task is to identify all references that co-refer. Due to practical significance of the ER problem, many creative ER techniques have been proposed in the past, including those that analyze relationships that exist among entities in data. Such approaches view the database as an entity-relationship graph, where direct and indirect relationships correspond to paths in the graph. These techniques rely on measuring theconnection strengthamong various nodes in the graph by using a connection strength (CS) model. While such approaches have demonstrated significant advantage over traditional ER techniques, currently they also have a significant limitation: the CS models that they use are intuition-based fixed models that tend to behave well in general, but are very generic and not tuned to a specific domain, leading to suboptimal result quality. Hence, in this article we propose an approach that employs supervised learning to adapt the connection strength measure to the given domain using the available past/training data. The adaptive approach has several advantages: it increases both the quality and efficiency of ER and it also minimizes the domain analyst participation needed to tune the CS model to the given domain. The extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach reaches up to 8&percnt; higher accuracy than the graph-based ER methods that use fixed and intuition-based CS models.","title":"Adaptive Connection Strength Models for Relationship-Based Entity Resolution","doi":"doi>10.1145/2435221.2435224"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81363603849","last_name":"nuray-turan","fist_name":"rabia","full_name":"Rabia Nuray-Turan"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"v","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100458924","last_name":"kalashnikov","fist_name":"dmitri","full_name":"Dmitri V Kalashnikov"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331499070","last_name":"mehrotra","fist_name":"sharad","full_name":"Sharad Mehrotra"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"SPECIAL ISSUE ON ENTITY RESOLUTION Overview: The Criticality of Entity Resolution in Data and Information Quality","doi":"doi>10.1145/2435221.2435222"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This article discusses the topics, approaches, and lessons learned in teaching a graduate-level course covering entity resolution (ER) and its relationship to information quality (IQ).

The key issues in developing an entity coreference algorithm include how to locate context information and how to utilize the context appropriately. In this article, we present a novel entity coreference algorithm for ontology instances. For scalability reasons, we select a neighborhood of each instance from an RDF graph. To determine the similarity between two instances, our algorithm computes the similarity between comparable property values in the neighborhood graphs. The similarity of distinct URIs and blank nodes is computed by comparing their outgoing links. In an attempt to reduce the impact of distant nodes on the final similarity measure, we explore a distance-based discounting approach. To provide the best possible domain-independent matches, we propose an approach to compute the discriminability of triples in order to assign weights to the context information. We evaluated our algorithm using different instance categories from five datasets.

Knowledge of the specific systematic bias patterns in the incidence of missing data can help analysts more accurately assess the quality of conclusions drawn from data sets with missing data. This research proposes a methodology to combine a number of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining techniques, including association rule mining, to discover patterns in related attribute values that help characterize these bias patterns.

As a result, in conjunctive decisions, the probability of a false negative increases while the probability of a false positive decreases. In contrast, in disjunctive decisions, as we keep adding criteria, the probability of a false positive increases while that of a false negative decreases.

An alternative approach to improve data quality is to exploit different data sources that contain information about the same set of objects. Such overlapping sources highlight hot-spots of poor data quality through conflicting data values and immediately provide alternative values for conflict resolution. In order to derive a dataset of high quality, we can merge the overlapping sources based on a quality assessment of the conflicting values. The quality of the resulting dataset, however, is highly dependent on our ability to asses the quality of conflicting values effectively.The main objective of this article is to introduce methods that aid the developer of an integrated system over overlapping, but contradicting sources in the task of improving the quality of data. Value conflicts between contradicting sources are often systematic, caused by some characteristic of the different sources. Our goal is to identify such systematic differences and outline data patterns that occur in conjunction with them. Evaluated by an expert user, the regularities discovered provide insights into possible conflict reasons and help to assess the quality of inconsistent values. The contributions of this article are two concepts of systematic conflicts: contradiction patterns and minimal update sequences. Contradiction patterns resemble a special form of association rules that summarize characteristic data properties for conflict occurrence. We adapt existing association rule mining algorithms for mining contradiction patterns. Contradiction patterns, however, view each class of conflicts in isolation, sometimes leading to largely overlapping patterns. Sequences of set-oriented update operations that transform one data source into the other are compact descriptions for all regular differences among the sources. We consider minimal update sequences as the most likely explanation for observed differences between overlapping data sources. Furthermore, the order of operations within the sequences point out potential dependencies between systematic differences. Finding minimal update sequences, however, is beyond reach in practice. We show that the problem already is NP-complete for a restricted set of operations. In the light of this intractability result, we present heuristics that lead to convincing results for all examples we considered.","title":"Improving data quality by source analysis","doi":"doi>10.1145/2107536.2107538"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81381604158","last_name":"muller","fist_name":"heiko","full_name":"Heiko Muller"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100333077","last_name":"freytag","fist_name":"johann-christoph","full_name":"Johann-Christoph Freytag"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100520165","last_name":"leser","fist_name":"ulf","full_name":"Ulf Leser"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"This article analyzes the data quality issues that emerge when training a shrinkage-based classifier with noisy data.

Subsequently, the quality of the sample data is incrementally deteriorated by simulating errors in the text and/or codes.

The fact that an impostor can pass as the genuine user by possession of stolen identification information is a weakness in current authentication systems. Adding a biometric layer to the traditional knowledge and token-based authentication systems is one way to counter this problem. Physical biometrics, such as fingerprint systems, are highly accurate; hence, they would be the first choice for such applications but are often inappropriate. Behavioral biometrics, like biometric typing patterns, have the potential to fill this gap as another level of security but this research identified some deficiencies in performance quality. Two research streams for improvements have emerged. The first approach attempts to improve performance by building better classifiers, while the second attempts to attain the same goal by using richer identifying inputs. Both streams assume that the typing biometric patterns are stable over time. This study investigates the validity of this assumption by analyzing how students’ typing patterns behave over time. The results demonstrate that typing patterns change over time due to learning resulting in several performance quality challenges. First, the changing patterns lead to deteriorating authentication accuracy. Second, the relevancy of the reference biometric template created during training becomes questionable. Third, the deterioration in accuracy compromises the security of the whole system and fourth, the net effect brings to question whether the biometric keypad is no longer “fit for use” as an authentication system. These are critical data quality issues that need to be addressed if behavioral biometrics are to play a significant role in minimizing authentication fraud. Possible solutions to the problem, including biometric template updating and choice of uncorrelated PIN combinations, are suggested as potential topics for future research.","title":"Typing Biometrics: Impact of Human Learning on Performance Quality","doi":"doi>10.1145/1891879.1891884"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438596762","last_name":"ngugi","fist_name":"benjamin","full_name":"Benjamin Ngugi"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"k","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100452955","last_name":"kahn","fist_name":"beverly","full_name":"Beverly K Kahn"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100180541","last_name":"tremaine","fist_name":"marilyn","full_name":"Marilyn Tremaine"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The relationship between data accuracy and the resulting information accuracy is of great interest in numerous problem domains.

Successful handling of these challenges will lead to improved quality in healthcare by reducing medical errors, decreasing costs, and enhancing patient care. The study is focused on the following goals: (1) understanding the role of EHRs; (2) understanding the need for standardization to improve quality; (3) establishing interoperability in maintaining EHRs; (4) examining a framework for standardization and interoperability (the openEHR architecture; (5) identifying the role of archetypes for knowledge-based systems; and (6) understanding the difficulties in querying HER data.","title":"Semantic interoperability in standardized electronic health record databases","doi":"doi>10.1145/2166788.2166789"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474653815","last_name":"sachdeva","fist_name":"shelly","full_name":"Shelly Sachdeva"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100367378","last_name":"bhalla","fist_name":"subhash","full_name":"Subhash Bhalla"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) performs over 800,000 disability exams and distributes over &dollor;37 billion in disability benefits per year. VA developed and deployed a computer-based disability exam documentation system in order to improve exam report quality and timeliness. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing joint disability examinations supported by computerized templates to the examinations documented via dictation, to determine if the system met the intended goals or had unintended consequences. Consenting veterans were randomized to undergo exams documented using computerized templates or via dictation. We compared exam report quality, documentation time costs, encounter length, total time to fulfill an exam request with a finalized exam report, and veteran satisfaction. Computer-based templates resulted in disability exam reports that had higher quality scores (p. 0.042) and were returned to the requesting office faster than exam reports created via dictation (p. 0.02).Documentation time and veteran satisfaction were similar for both the documentation techniques. Encounter length was significantly longer for the template group. Computer-based templates impacted the VA disability evaluation system by improving report quality scores and production time and lengthening encounter times. Oversight bodies have called for mandated use of computer-based templates nationwide. We believe mandates regarding use of health information technology should be guided by data regarding its positive and negative impacts.","title":"Documentation quality and time costs: A randomized controlled trial of structured entry versus dictation","doi":"doi>10.1145/2166788.2166790"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100013003","last_name":"brown","fist_name":"steven","full_name":"Steven Brown"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"s","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502802442","last_name":"rosenbloom","fist_name":"trent","full_name":"Trent S Rosenbloom"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"p","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502805061","last_name":"hardenbrook","fist_name":"shawn","full_name":"Shawn P Hardenbrook"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502769705","last_name":"clark","fist_name":"terry","full_name":"Terry Clark"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502802505","last_name":"fielstein","fist_name":"elliot","full_name":"Elliot Fielstein"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100572351","last_name":"elkin","fist_name":"peter","full_name":"Peter Elkin"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502808580","last_name":"speroff","fist_name":"ted","full_name":"Ted Speroff"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Companies acquire personal information from phone, World Wide Web, or email in order to sell or send an advertisement about their product.

To this end, users are being asked to query these databases to provide information to help answer questions posed by key management personnel. Users who have had extensive experience with an organization’s data can often detect the presence of errors in their queries when query results do not correspond to their ex ante expectations. New users, however, are less familiar with the data they will be querying. Having no, or limited, ex ante expectations for query results, new users may be unaware that the result produced by their query is incorrect. Unwarranted confidence in the correctness of their queries predisposes these users to stop looking for query errors even when their queries still contain errors. This behavior, premature stopping of query revision, prompts investigating whether new users’ query performance would improve if they were not only provided with, but used, readily available information to form ex ante expectations. Our results demonstrated a threshold effect in new users heeding information for forming ex ante expectations. That is, the mere availability of information for forming ex ante expectations made no difference in query performance. When admonishing users to heed ex ante information, however, there was an associated increase in the accuracy of their queries. These results suggest that users unfamiliar with a particular database might make fewer query errors if they not only received readily available information but were then prompted to use the information to form ex ante expectations for query results.","title":"Improving New Users’ Query Performance: Deterring Premature Stopping of Query Revision with Information for Forming Ex Ante Expectations","doi":"doi>10.1145/2348828.2348829"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"a","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005459","last_name":"robb","fist_name":"david","full_name":"David A Robb"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"l","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100004103","last_name":"bowen","fist_name":"paul","full_name":"Paul L Bowen"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"faye","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005460","last_name":"borthick","fist_name":"a","full_name":"A Faye Borthick"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"h","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548005461","last_name":"rohde","fist_name":"fiona","full_name":"Fiona H Rohde"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Developing policies to screen documents for deception is often hampered by the cost of data collection and the inability to evaluate policy alternatives due to lack of data.

This article studies the impact of artificially generated deception on document screening policies. The deception and truth data were collected from financial aid applications, a document-centric area with limited resources for screening. Real deception was augmented with artificial data generated by noise and deception generation models. Using the real data and artificially generated data, we designed an innovative experiment with deception type and deception rate as factors, and harmonic mean and cost as outcome variables. We used two budget models (fixed and variable) typically employed by financial aid offices to measure the cost of noncompliance in financial aid applications. The analysis included an evaluation of a common policy for deception screening using both fixed and varying screening rates. The results of the experiment provided evidence of similar performance of screening policy with real and artificial deception, suggesting the possibility of using artificially generated deception to reduce the costs associated with obtaining training data.","title":"An Experimental Comparison of a Document Deception Detection Policy using Real and Artificial Deception","doi":"doi>10.1145/2287714.2287716"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502696183","last_name":"yang","fist_name":"yanjuan","full_name":"Yanjuan Yang"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Record linkage is used to associate entities from multiple data sources. For example, two organizations contemplating a merger may want to know how common their customer bases are so that they may better assess the benefits of the merger. Another example is a database of people who are forbidden from a certain activity by regulators, may need to be compared to a list of people engaged in that activity. The autonomous entities who wish to carry out the record matching computation are often reluctant to fully share their data; they fear losing control over its subsequent dissemination and usage, or they want to insure privacy because the data is proprietary or confidential, and/or they are cautious simply because privacy laws forbid its disclosure or regulate the form of that disclosure. In such cases, the problem of carrying out the linkage computation without full data exchange has been calledprivate record linkage. Previous private record linkage techniques have made use of a third party. We provide efficient techniques for private record linkage that improve on previous work in that (1) our techniques make no use of a third party, and (2) they achieve much better performance than previous schemes in terms of their execution time while maintaining acceptable quality of output compared to nonprivacy settings. Our protocol consists of two phases. The first phase primarily produces candidate record pairs for matching, by carrying out a very fast (but not accurate) matching between such pairs of records. The second phase is a novel protocol for efficiently computing distances between each candidate pair (without any expensive cryptographic operations such as modular exponentiations).

These programs often rely on recording longitudinal patient data and analyzing it. Therefore, maintaining appropriate data quality is important for self-management programs to be efficient and safe.

The accuracy of the segmentation subsystem determines the performance of the other subsystems in any computer aided diagnosis system based on image analysis.

The goal of this work is to present an automated approach to segmentation of lung parenchyma from the rest of the chest CT image. The approach involves the conventional optimal thresholding technique and operations based on convex edge and centroid properties of the lung region. The segmentation technique proposed in this article can be used to preprocess lung images given to a computer aided diagnosis system for diagnosis of lung disorders. This improves the diagnostic performance of the system. This has been tested by using it in a computer aided diagnosis system that was used for detection of lung cancer from chest computed tomography images. The results obtained show that the lungs can be correctly segmented even in the presence of peripheral pathology bearing regions; pathology bearing regions that could not be detected using a CAD system that applies optimal thresholding could be detected using a CAD system using out proposed approach for segmentation of lungs.","title":"A novel segmentation approach for improving diagnostic accuracy of CAD systems for detecting lung cancer from chest computed tomography images","doi":"doi>10.1145/2184442.2184444"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"shiloah","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447604376","last_name":"elizabeth","fist_name":"d","full_name":"D Shiloah Elizabeth"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"khanna","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81447602576","last_name":"nehemiah","fist_name":"h","full_name":"H Khanna Nehemiah"}]},{"row":[{"link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81502683777"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461653781","last_name":"kannan","fist_name":"a","full_name":"A Kannan"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"The data extracted from electronic archives is a valuable asset; however, the issue of the (poor) data quality should be addressed before performing data analysis and decision-making activities.

We apply the analysis framework to synthetic and real-world provenance.","title":"Provenance Quality Assessment Methodology and Framework","doi":"doi>10.1145/2665069"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479650100","last_name":"cheah","fist_name":"you-wei","full_name":"You-Wei Cheah"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100418166","last_name":"plale","fist_name":"beth","full_name":"Beth Plale"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Information Quality Research Challenge: Adapting Information Quality Principles to User-Generated Content","doi":"doi>10.1145/2723166"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100131987","last_name":"parsons","fist_name":"jeffrey","full_name":"Jeffrey Parsons"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"We present techniques for gathering data that expose errors of automatic predictive models. In certain common settings, traditional methods for evaluating predictive models tend to miss rare but important errors—most importantly, cases for which the model is confident of its prediction (but wrong). In this article, we present a system that, in a game-like setting, asks humans to identify cases that will cause the predictive model-based system to fail. Such techniques are valuable in discovering problematic cases that may not reveal themselves during the normal operation of the system and may include cases that are rare but catastrophic. We describe the design of the system, including design iterations that did not quite work. In particular, the system incentivizes humans to provide examples that are difficult for the model to handle by providing a reward proportional to the magnitude of the predictive model's error. The humans are asked to “Beat the Machine” and find cases where the automatic model (“the Machine”) is wrong. Experiments show that the humans using Beat the Machine identify more errors than do traditional techniques for discovering errors in predictive models, and, indeed, they identify many more errors where the machine is (wrongly) confident it is correct. Furthermore, those cases the humans identify seem to be not simply outliers, but coherent areas missed completely by the model. Beat the Machine identifies the “unknown unknowns.” Beat the Machine has been deployed at an industrial scale by several companies. The main impact has been that firms are changing their perspective on and practice of evaluating predictive models.“There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don't know we don't know.”--Donald Rumsfeld","title":"Beat the Machine: Challenging Humans to Find a Predictive Model's “Unknown Unknowns”","doi":"doi>10.1145/2700832"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350605431","last_name":"attenberg","fist_name":"joshua","full_name":"Joshua Attenberg"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100225930","last_name":"ipeirotis","fist_name":"panos","full_name":"Panos Ipeirotis"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100596683","last_name":"provost","fist_name":"foster","full_name":"Foster Provost"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Organizations that develop and use technologies around information retrieval, machine learning, recommender systems, and natural language processing depend on labels for engineering and experimentation.

A quick literature survey shows that a significant number of information quality frameworks are proposed in different domains of application: management information systems, web information systems, information fusion systems, and so forth. Unfortunately, they do not provide a feasible methodology that is both simple and intuitive to be implemented in practice. In order to address this need, we present in this article a new information quality methodology. Our methodology makes use of existing frameworks and proposes a three-step process capable of tracking the quality changes through the system. In the first step and as a novelty compared to existing studies, we propose decomposing the information system into its elementary modules. Having access to each module allows us to locally define the information quality. Then, in the second step, we model each processing module by a quality transfer function, capturing the module’s influence over the information quality. In the third step, we make use of the previous two steps in order to estimate the quality of the entire information system. Thus, our methodology allows informing the end-user on both output quality and local quality. The proof of concept of our methodology has been carried out considering two applications: an automatic target recognition system and a diagnosis coding support system.","title":"A Methodology to

We also developed a concatenation structure to allow the handling of company name changes, mergers, and spin-offs without artificially altering numerical series. At the same time, we maintained the transparency of the historical information on each individual company listed. Thanks to the overlapping of digital and hand-collected data, the completed database has a very high level of detail and accuracy. The dataset is particularly suited for any empirical research in financial economics and for more practically oriented numerical applications and forecasting simulations.","title":"Design and Construction of a Historical Financial Database of the Italian Stock Market 1973--2011","doi":"doi>10.1145/2822898"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487654361","last_name":"coletti","fist_name":"paolo","full_name":"Paolo Coletti"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658755187","last_name":"murgia","fist_name":"maurizio","full_name":"Maurizio Murgia"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"Real-time Entity Resolution (ER) is the process of matching query records in subsecond time with records in a database that represent the same real-world entity. Indexing techniques are generally used to efficiently extract a set of candidate records from the database that are similar to a query record, and that are to be compared with the query record in more detail. The sorted neighborhood indexing method, which sorts a database and compares records within a sliding window, has been successfully used for ER of large static databases. However, because it is based on static sorted arrays and is designed for batch ER that resolves all records in a database rather than resolving those relating to a single query record, this technique is not suitable for real-time ER on dynamic databases that are constantly updated. We propose a tree-based technique that facilitates dynamic indexing based on the sorted neighborhood method, which can be used for real-time ER, and investigate both static and adaptive window approaches. We propose an approach to reduce query matching times by precalculating the similarities between attribute values stored in neighboring tree nodes. We also propose a multitree solution where different sorting keys are used to reduce the effects of errors and variations in attribute values on matching quality by building several distinct index trees. We experimentally evaluate our proposed techniques on large real datasets, as well as on synthetic data with different data quality characteristics. Our results show that as the index grows, no appreciable increase occurs in both record insertion and query times, and that using multiple trees gives noticeable improvements on matching quality with only a small increase in query time. Compared to earlier indexing techniques for real-time ER, our approach achieves significantly reduced indexing and query matching times while maintaining high matching accuracy.","title":"Dynamic Sorted Neighborhood Indexing for Real-Time Entity Resolution","doi":"doi>10.1145/2816821"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658653781","last_name":"ramadan","fist_name":"banda","full_name":"Banda Ramadan"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":" ","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81438593067","last_name":"liang","fist_name":"huizhi","full_name":"Huizhi Liang"}]},{"row":[{"middle_name":"w","link":"http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81331492896","last_name":"gayler","fist_name":"ross","full_name":"Ross W Gayler"}]},{"row":[{"abstract":"An abstract is not available.","title":"Corrigendum to the Special Issue Editorial in JDIQ Volume 5, Issue 3","doi":"doi>10.1145/2821019"}]}]}],"errors":[]}
